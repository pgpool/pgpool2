   <para>
    The first step of the installation procedure is to configure the
    source tree for your system and choose the options you would like.
    This is done by running the <filename>configure</> script. For a
    default installation simply enter:
<screen>
<userinput>./configure</userinput>
</screen>
    This script will run a number of tests to determine values for various
    system dependent variables and detect any quirks of your
    operating system, and finally will create several files in the
    build tree to record what it found.  You can also run
    <filename>configure</filename> in a directory outside the source
    tree, if you want to keep the build directory separate.  This
    procedure is also called a
    <indexterm><primary>VPATH</primary></indexterm><firstterm>VPATH</firstterm>
    build.  Here's how:
<screen>
<userinput>mkdir build_dir</userinput>
<userinput>cd build_dir</userinput>
<userinput>/path/to/source/tree/configure [options go here]</userinput>
<userinput>make</userinput>
</screen>
   </para>

   <para>
    The default configuration will build the server and utilities, as
    well as all client applications and interfaces that require only a
    C compiler. All files will be installed under
    <filename>/usr/local/pgsql</> by default.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can customize the build and installation process by supplying one
    or more of the following command line options to
    <filename>configure</filename>:

     <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
       <term><option>--prefix=<replaceable>PREFIX</></option></term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         Install all files under the directory <replaceable>PREFIX</>
         instead of <filename>/usr/local/pgsql</filename>. The actual
         files will be installed into various subdirectories; no files
         will ever be installed directly into the
         <replaceable>PREFIX</> directory.
        </para>

        <para>
         If you have special needs, you can also customize the
         individual subdirectories with the following options. However,
         if you leave these with their defaults, the installation will be
         relocatable, meaning you can move the directory after
         installation. (The <literal>man</> and <literal>doc</>
         locations are not affected by this.)
        </para>

        <para>
         For relocatable installs, you might want to use
         <filename>configure</filename>'s <literal>--disable-rpath</>
         option.  Also, you will need to tell the operating system how
         to find the shared libraries.
        </para>

      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
       <term><option>--exec-prefix=<replaceable>EXEC-PREFIX</></option></term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         You can install architecture-dependent files under a
         different prefix, <replaceable>EXEC-PREFIX</>, than what
         <replaceable>PREFIX</> was set to. This can be useful to
         share architecture-independent files between hosts. If you
         omit this, then <replaceable>EXEC-PREFIX</> is set equal to
         <replaceable>PREFIX</> and both architecture-dependent and
         independent files will be installed under the same tree,
         which is probably what you want.

         Compiles all programs and libraries with debugging symbols.
         This means that you can run the programs in a debugger
         to analyze problems. This enlarges the size of the installed
         executables considerably, and on non-GCC compilers it usually
         also disables compiler optimization, causing slowdowns. However,
         having the symbols available is extremely helpful for dealing
         with any problems that might arise.  Currently, this option is
         recommended for production installations only if you use GCC.
         But you should always have it on if you are doing development work
         or running a beta version.

     <para>
      When developing code inside the server, it is recommended to
      use the configure options <option>--enable-cassert</> (which
      turns on many run-time error checks) and <option>--enable-debug</>
      (which improves the usefulness of debugging tools).
     </para>

     <para>
      If using GCC, it is best to build with an optimization level of
      at least <option>-O1</>, because using no optimization
      (<option>-O0</>) disables some important compiler warnings (such
      as the use of uninitialized variables).  However, non-zero
      optimization levels can complicate debugging because stepping
      through compiled code will usually not match up one-to-one with
      source code lines.  If you get confused while trying to debug
      optimized code, recompile the specific files of interest with
      <option>-O0</>.  An easy way to do this is by passing an option
      to <application>make</>: <command>make PROFILE=-O0 file.o</>.

    You can use <literal>make install-strip</literal> instead of

    remove the debugging support, so it should only be done if
    debugging is no longer needed.  <literal>install-strip</literal>
    tries to do a reasonable job saving space, but it does not have
    perfect knowledge of how to strip every unneeded byte from an
    executable file, so if you want to save all the disk space you
    possibly can, you will have to do manual work.

    After the installation you can free disk space by removing the built

    program, so that you can rebuild everything with <command>make</>
    later on. To reset the source tree to the state in which it was
    distributed, use <command>make distclean</>. If you are going to
    build for several platforms within the same source tree you must do
    this and re-configure for each platform.  (Alternatively, use
    a separate build tree for each platform, so that the source tree
    remains unmodified.)

   If you perform a build and then discover that your <command>configure</>

   idea to do <command>make distclean</> before reconfiguring and
   rebuilding.  Without this, your changes in configuration choices
   might not propagate everywhere they need to.

   <title>Shared Libraries</title>

   <indexterm>
    <primary>shared library</primary>
   </indexterm>

   <para>
    On some systems with shared libraries
    you need to tell the system how to find the newly installed
    shared libraries.  The systems on which this is
    <emphasis>not</emphasis> necessary include
    <systemitem class="osname">FreeBSD</>,
    <systemitem class="osname">HP-UX</>,
    <systemitem class="osname">Linux</>,
    <systemitem class="osname">NetBSD</>, <systemitem
    class="osname">OpenBSD</>, and
    <systemitem class="osname">Solaris</>.
   </para>

   <para>
    The method to set the shared library search path varies between
    platforms, but the most widely-used method is to set the
    environment variable <envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</> like so: In Bourne
    shells (<command>sh</>, <command>ksh</>, <command>bash</>, <command>zsh</>):
<programlisting>
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</programlisting>
    or in <command>csh</> or <command>tcsh</>:
<programlisting>
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/pgsql/lib
</programlisting>
    Replace <literal>/usr/local/pgsql/lib</> with whatever you set
    <option><literal>--libdir</></> to in <xref linkend="configure">.
    You should put these commands into a shell start-up file such as
    <filename>/etc/profile</> or <filename>~/.bash_profile</>.  Some
    good information about the caveats associated with this method can
    be found at <ulink
    url="http://xahlee.org/UnixResource_dir/_/ldpath.html"></ulink>.
   </para>

   <para>
    On some systems it might be preferable to set the environment
    variable <envar>LD_RUN_PATH</envar> <emphasis>before</emphasis>
    building.
   </para>

   <para>
    On <systemitem class="osname">Cygwin</systemitem>, put the library
    directory in the <envar>PATH</envar> or move the
    <filename>.dll</filename> files into the <filename>bin</filename>
    directory.
   </para>

   <para>
    If in doubt, refer to the manual pages of your system (perhaps
    <command>ld.so</command> or <command>rld</command>). If you later
    get a message like:
<screen>
psql: error in loading shared libraries
libpq.so.2.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
</screen>
    then this step was necessary.  Simply take care of it then.
   </para>

   <para>
    <indexterm>
     <primary>ldconfig</primary>
    </indexterm>
    If you are on <systemitem class="osname">Linux</> and you have root
    access, you can run:
<programlisting>
/sbin/ldconfig /usr/local/pgsql/lib
</programlisting>
    (or equivalent directory) after installation to enable the
    run-time linker to find the shared libraries faster.  Refer to the
    manual page of <command>ldconfig</> for more information.  On
    <systemitem class="osname">FreeBSD</>, <systemitem
    class="osname">NetBSD</>, and <systemitem
    class="osname">OpenBSD</> the command is:
<programlisting>
/sbin/ldconfig -m /usr/local/pgsql/lib
</programlisting>
    instead.  Other systems are not known to have an equivalent
    command.

   <para>
    If you installed into <filename>/usr/local/pgsql</> or some other
    location that is not searched for programs by default, you should
    add <filename>/usr/local/pgsql/bin</> (or whatever you set
    <option><literal>--bindir</></> to in <xref linkend="configure">)
    into your <envar>PATH</>.  Strictly speaking, this is not
    necessary, but it will make the use of <productname>PostgreSQL</>
    much more convenient.
   </para>

   <para>
    To do this, add the following to your shell start-up file, such as
    <filename>~/.bash_profile</> (or <filename>/etc/profile</>, if you
    want it to affect all users):
<programlisting>
PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/bin:$PATH
export PATH
</programlisting>
    If you are using <command>csh</> or <command>tcsh</>, then use this command:
<programlisting>
set path = ( /usr/local/pgsql/bin $path )
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    <indexterm>
     <primary><envar>MANPATH</envar></primary>
    </indexterm>
    To enable your system to find the <application>man</>
    documentation, you need to add lines like the following to a
    shell start-up file unless you installed into a location that is
    searched by default:
<programlisting>
MANPATH=/usr/local/pgsql/man:$MANPATH
export MANPATH
</programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    The environment variables <envar>PGHOST</> and <envar>PGPORT</>
    specify to client applications the host and port of the database
    server, overriding the compiled-in defaults. If you are going to
    run client applications remotely then it is convenient if every
    user that plans to use the database sets <envar>PGHOST</>.  This
    is not required, however; the settings can be communicated via command
    line options to most client programs.

  <title>Getting Started</title>

  <para>
   The following is a quick summary of how to get <productname>PostgreSQL</> up and
   running once installed. The main documentation contains more information.
  </para>

  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     Create a user account for the <productname>PostgreSQL</>
     server. This is the user the server will run as. For production
     use you should create a separate, unprivileged account
     (<quote>postgres</> is commonly used). If you do not have root
     access or just want to play around, your own user account is
     enough, but running the server as root is a security risk and
     will not work.
<screen>
<userinput>adduser postgres</>
</screen>
    </para>
   </step>

   <step>
    <para>
     Create a database installation with the <command>initdb</>
     command. To run <command>initdb</> you must be logged in to your
     <productname>PostgreSQL</> server account. It will not work as
     root.
<screen>
root# <userinput>mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data</>
root# <userinput>chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data</>
root# <userinput>su - postgres</>
postgres$ <userinput>/usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data</>
</screen>
    </para>

    <para>
     The <option>-D</> option specifies the location where the data
     will be stored. You can use any path you want, it does not have
     to be under the installation directory. Just make sure that the
     server account can write to the directory (or create it, if it
     doesn't already exist) before starting <command>initdb</>, as
     illustrated here.
    </para>
   </step>

   <step>
    <para>
     At this point, if you did not use the <command>initdb</> <literal>-A</>
     option, you might want to modify <filename>pg_hba.conf</> to control
     local access to the server before you start it.  The default is to
     trust all local users.
    </para>
   </step>

   <step>
    <para>
     The previous <command>initdb</> step should have told you how to
     start up the database server. Do so now. The command should look
     something like:
<programlisting>
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
</programlisting>
     This will start the server in the foreground. To put the server
     in the background use something like:
<programlisting>
nohup /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data \
    &lt;/dev/null &gt;&gt;server.log 2&gt;&amp;1 &lt;/dev/null &amp;
</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     To stop a server running in the background you can type:
<programlisting>
kill `cat /usr/local/pgsql/data/postmaster.pid`
</programlisting>
    </para>
   </step>

   <step>
    <para>
     Create a database:
<screen>
<userinput>createdb testdb</>
</screen>
     Then enter:
<screen>
<userinput>psql testdb</>
</screen>
     to connect to that database. At the prompt you can enter SQL
     commands and start experimenting.

  <title>Supported Platforms</title>

  <para>
   A platform (that is, a CPU architecture and operating system combination)
   is considered supported by the <productname>PostgreSQL</> development
   community if the code contains provisions to work on that platform and
   it has recently been verified to build and pass its regression tests
   on that platform.  Currently, most testing of platform compatibility
   is done automatically by test machines in the
   <ulink url="http://buildfarm.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL Build Farm</ulink>.
   If you are interested in using <productname>PostgreSQL</> on a platform
   that is not represented in the build farm, but on which the code works
   or can be made to work, you are strongly encouraged to set up a build
   farm member machine so that continued compatibility can be assured.
  </para>

  <para>
   In general, <productname>PostgreSQL</> can be expected to work on
   these CPU architectures: x86, x86_64, IA64, PowerPC,
   PowerPC 64, S/390, S/390x, Sparc, Sparc 64, ARM, MIPS, MIPSEL, M68K,
   and PA-RISC.  Code support exists for M32R and VAX, but these
   architectures are not known to have been tested recently.  It is often
   possible to build on an unsupported CPU type by configuring with
   <option>--disable-spinlocks</option>, but performance will be poor.
  </para>

  <para>
   <productname>PostgreSQL</> can be expected to work on these operating
   systems: Linux (all recent distributions), Windows (Win2000 SP4 and later),
   FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, OS X, AIX, HP/UX, Solaris,
   and UnixWare.  Other Unix-like systems may also work but are not currently
   being tested.  In most cases, all CPU architectures supported by
   a given operating system will work.  Look in
   the <xref linkend="installation-platform-notes"> below to see if
   there is information
   specific to your operating system, particularly if using an older system.

  <para>
   If you have installation problems on a platform that is known
   to be supported according to recent build farm results, please report
   it to <email>pgsql-bugs@postgresql.org</email>.  If you are interested
