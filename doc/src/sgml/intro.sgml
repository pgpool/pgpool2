  This book is the official documentation of
  <productname>pgpool-II</productname>.  It has been written by the
  <productname>pgpool-II</productname> developers and other
  volunteers in parallel to the development of the
  <productname>pgpool-II</productname> software.  It describes all
  the functionality that the current version of
  <productname>pgpool-II</productname> officially supports.

  To make the large amount of information about
  <productname>pgpool-II</productname> manageable, this book has been
  organized in several parts.  Each part is targeted at a different
  class of users, or at users in different stages of their
  <productname>pgpool-II</productname> experience:

  <title> What is <productname>pgpool-II</productname>?</title>

  <para>
    <productname>pgpool-II</productname> is a proxy software that sits
    between <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> servers and a
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> database client. It provides
    the following features:

  <variablelist>

   <varlistentry>
    <term>Connection Pooling</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>
	<productname>pgpool-II</productname> maintains established
	connections to the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
	servers, and reuses them whenever a new connection with the
	same properties (i.e. user name, database, protocol version)
	comes in. It reduces the connection overhead, and improves
	system's overall throughput.
      </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term>Load Balancing</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>
	If a database is replicated (because running in either
	replication mode or master/slave mode), performing a SELECT
	query on any server will return the same result. <productname>pgpool-II</productname>
	takes advantage of the replication feature in order to reduce
	the load on each PostgreSQL server.  It does that by
	distributing SELECT queries among available servers, improving
	the system's overall throughput. In an ideal scenario, read
	performance could improve proportionally to the number of
	PostgreSQL servers. Load balancing works best in a scenario
	where there are a lot of users executing many read-only
	queries at the same time.
      </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term>Automated fail over</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>
	If one of database servers goes down or becomes unrechable,
	<productname>pgpool-II</productname> will detaches it and continues operations using rest
	of database servers. There are some sophiscated features which
	help the automated fail over including timeout and retres.
      </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term>Replication</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>
	<productname>pgpool-II</productname> can manage
	multiple <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
	servers. Activating the replication feature makes it possible
	to create a real time backup on 2 or
	more <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> clusters, so that
	the service can continue without interruption if one of those
	clusters fails. <productname>pgpool-II</productname> has
	built-in replication (native replication). However user can
	use external replication features including streaming
	replication of <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.
      </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

   <varlistentry>
    <term>Limiting Exceeding Connections</term>
    <listitem>
      <para>
	There is a limit on the maximum number of concurrent
	connections with <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>, and
	new connections are rejected when this number is
	reached. Raising this maximum number of connections, however,
	increases resource consumption and has a negative impact on
	overall system
	performance. <productname>pgpool-II</productname> also has a
	limit on the maximum number of connections, but extra
	connections will be queued instead of returning an error
	immediately.
	</para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>

  </variablelist>

  </para>

  <para>
    <productname>pgpool-II</productname> speaks PostgreSQL's backend
    and frontend protocol, and relays messages between a backend and a
    frontend. Therefore, a database application (frontend) thinks
    that <productname>pgpool-II</productname> is the
    actual <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server, and the
    server (backend) sees <productname>pgpool-II</productname> as one
    of its clients. Because
    <productname>pgpool-II</productname> is transparent to both the server and the client, an
    existing database application can be used with <productname>pgpool-II</productname> almost
    without a change to its source code.
  </para>

  <para>
    There are some restrictions to using SQL via <productname>pgpool-II</productname>.
    See Restrictions for more details.
