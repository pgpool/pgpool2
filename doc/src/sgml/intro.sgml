  This book is the official documentation of
  <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>.  It has been written by the
  <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> developers and other
  volunteers in parallel to the development of the
  <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> software.  It describes all
  the functionality that the current version of
  <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> officially supports.

  <title> What is <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>?</title>

  <para>
   <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> is a proxy software that sits
   between <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> servers and a
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> database client. It provides
   the following features:

   <variablelist>

    <varlistentry>
     <term>Connection Pooling</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> maintains established
       connections to the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
       servers, and reuses them whenever a new connection with the
       same properties (i.e. user name, database, protocol version, and other connection parameters if any)
       comes in. It reduces the connection overhead, and improves
       system's overall throughput.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term>Load Balancing</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       If a database is replicated (because running in either
       replication mode or master/slave mode), performing a SELECT
       query on any server will return the same result. <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>
       takes advantage of the replication feature in order to reduce
       the load on each PostgreSQL server.  It does that by
       distributing SELECT queries among available servers, improving
       the system's overall throughput. In an ideal scenario, read
       performance could improve proportionally to the number of
       PostgreSQL servers. Load balancing works best in a scenario
       where there are a lot of users executing many read-only
       queries at the same time.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term>Automated fail over</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       If one of the database servers goes down or becomes unreachable,
       <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> will detach it and will continue operations by using the rest
       of database servers. There are some sophisticated features that
       help the automated failover including timeouts and retries.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term>Online Recovery</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> can perform online recovery of database
       node by executing one command. When the online recovery is used with the
       automated fail over, a detached node by fail over is possible to attach as
       standby node automatically. It is possible to synchronize and attach new
       <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server too.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term>Replication</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> can manage
       multiple <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
       servers. Activating the replication feature makes it possible
       to create a real time backup on 2 or
       more <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> clusters, so that
       the service can continue without interruption if one of those
       clusters fails. <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> has
       built-in replication (native replication). However user can
       use external replication features including streaming
       replication of <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term>Limiting Exceeding Connections</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       There is a limit on the maximum number of concurrent
       connections with <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>, and
       new connections are rejected when this number is
       reached. Raising this maximum number of connections, however,
       increases resource consumption and has a negative impact on
       overall system
       performance. <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> also has a
       limit on the maximum number of connections, but extra
       connections will be queued instead of returning an error
       immediately. However, you can configure to return an error
       when the connection limit is exceeded (4.1 or later).
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term>Watchdog</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Watchdog can coordinate multiple <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>,
       create a robust cluster system and avoid the single point of failure or split brain.
       To avoid the split brain, you need at least 3 <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> nodes.
       Watchdog can perform lifecheck against other <productname>pgpool-II</productname> nodes,
       to detect a fault of <productname>Pgpoll-II</productname>.
       If active <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> goes down, standby
       <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> can be promoted to active, and take over Virtual IP.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term>In Memory Query Cache</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       In memory query cache allows to save a pair of SELECT statement and its result.
       If an identical SELECTs comes in, <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> returns the
       value from cache. Since no SQL parsing nor access to <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
       are involved, using in memory cache is extremely fast. On the other hand, it might
       be slower than the normal path in some cases, because it adds some overhead of storing cache data.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

   </variablelist>

  </para>

  <para>
   <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> speaks PostgreSQL's backend
   and frontend protocol, and relays messages between a backend and a
   frontend. Therefore, a database application (frontend) thinks
   that <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> is the
   actual <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server, and the
   server (backend) sees <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> as one
   of its clients. Because
   <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> is transparent to both the server and the client, an
   existing database application can be used with <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> almost
   without a change to its source code.
  </para>

  <para>
   <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> works on Linux, Solaris,
   FreeBSD, and most of the UNIX-like architectures. Windows is not
   supported. Supported PostgreSQL server's versions are 6.4 and
   higher.  If you are using <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
   7.3 or older, some features
   of <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> won't be available. But
   you shouldn't use such an old release anyway.  You must also make
   sure that all of your <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
   servers are using the same major version. In addition to this, we
   do not recommend mixing
   different <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> installation with
   different build options: including supporting SSL or not, to use
   --disable-integer-datetimes or not, different block size. These
   might affect part of functionality
   of <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>. The difference of
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> minor versions is not
   usually a problem. However we do not test every occurrence of
   minor versions and we recommend to use exact same minor version of
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.

   There are some restrictions to using SQL via <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>.
