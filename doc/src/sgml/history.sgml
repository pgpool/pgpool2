 <para>
   <productname>pgpool-II</productname> started its life as a personal
   project by Tatsuo Ishii.  In the project it was just a simple
   connection pooling software. So the
   name <productname>pgpool</productname> came from the fact.  The
   first version was in public in 2003.

 <para>
   In 2004, <productname>pgpool</productname> 1.0 was released with
   the native replication feature. In the same year 2.0 was release
   with load balancing, and support for version 3 frontend/backend
   protocol. In 2005, automated fail over and master slave mode
   support were added.

 <para>
   In 2006, <productname>pgpool</productname>
   became <productname>pgpool-II</productname>. The first release 1.0
   eliminated restrictions, for example the number
   of <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> servers were up to 2 in
   <productname>pgpool</productname>. Also many new features such as
   parallel query mode and PCP commands were added. Probably most
   imporant change between <productname>pgpool</productname>
   and <productname>pgpool-II</productname> was that the project was
   changed from the personal project to a group project owned by the
   Pgpool Developement Group.
