    of the SQL language, or <xref linkend="client-interfaces"> for
    information about developing applications for
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.  Those who set up and

  <title>The SQL Language</title>

  <partintro>
   <para>
    This part describes the use of the <acronym>SQL</acronym> language
    in <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.  We start with
    describing the general syntax of <acronym>SQL</acronym>, then
    explain how to create the structures to hold data, how to populate
    the database, and how to query it.  The middle part lists the
    available data types and functions for use in
    <acronym>SQL</acronym> commands.  The rest treats several
    aspects that are important for tuning a database for optimal
    performance.
   </para>

   <para>
    The information in this part is arranged so that a novice user can
    follow it start to end to gain a full understanding of the topics
    without having to refer forward too many times.  The chapters are
    intended to be self-contained, so that advanced users can read the
    chapters individually as they choose.  The information in this
    part is presented in a narrative fashion in topical units.
    Readers looking for a complete description of a particular command
    should see <xref linkend="reference">.
   </para>

   <para>
    Readers of this part should know how to connect to a
    <productname>PostgreSQL</> database and issue
    <acronym>SQL</acronym> commands.  Readers that are unfamiliar with
    these issues are encouraged to read <xref linkend="tutorial">
    first.  <acronym>SQL</acronym> commands are typically entered
    using the <productname>PostgreSQL</> interactive terminal
    <application>psql</application>, but other programs that have
    similar functionality can be used as well.

  <title>Client Interfaces</title>

  <partintro>
   <para>
    This part describes the client programming interfaces distributed
    with <productname>PostgreSQL</>.  Each of these chapters can be
    read independently.  Note that there are many other programming
    interfaces for client programs that are distributed separately and
    contain their own documentation (<xref linkend="external-projects">
    lists some of the more popular ones).  Readers of this part should be
    familiar with using <acronym>SQL</acronym> commands to manipulate
    and query the database (see <xref linkend="sql">) and of course
    with the programming language that the interface uses.

  <title>Server Programming</title>

  <partintro>
   <para>
    This part is about extending the server functionality with
    user-defined functions, data types, triggers, etc.  These are
    advanced topics which should probably be approached only after all
    the other user documentation about <productname>PostgreSQL</> has
    been understood.  Later chapters in this part describe the server-side
    programming languages available in the
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> distribution as well as
    general issues concerning server-side programming languages.  It
    is essential to read at least the earlier sections of <xref
    linkend="extend"> (covering functions) before diving into the
    material about server-side programming languages.
