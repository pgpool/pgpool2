	<para>
	  Improve the behavior of fail-over. (Tatsuo Ishii)
	</para>
	<para>
	  In the steaming replication mode, client sessions will not
	  be disconnected when a fail-over occurs any more if the
	  session does not use the failed standby server. If the
	  primary server goes down, still all sessions will be
	  disconnected. Health check timeout case will also cause the
	  full session disconnection. Other health check error,
	  including retry over case does not trigger full session
	  disconnection.
	</para>

	<para>
	  For user's convenience, "show pool_nodes" command shows the
	  session local load balance node info since this is important
	  for users in case of fail-over. If the load balance node is
	  not the failed node, the session will not be affected by
	  fail-over.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Also now it is possible to connect
	  to <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> even if it is doing
	  health checking retries. Before all attempt of connecting
	  to <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> failed while doing
	  health checking retries.  Before any attempt to connect to
	  <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> fails if it is doing a
	  health check against failed node even if
	  <xref linkend="guc-fail-over-on-backend-error"> is off
	  because <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> child first
	  tries to connect to all backend including the failed one and
	  exits if it fails to connect to a backend (of course it
	  fails). This is a temporary situation and will be resolved
	  before pgpool executes fail-over. However if the health check
	  is retrying, the temporary situation keeps longer depending
	  on the setting
	  of <xref linkend="guc-health-check-max-retries"> and
	  <xref linkend="guc-health-check-retry-delay">. This is not
	  good. Attached patch tries to mitigate the problem:
	</para>
	<para>
	  When an attempt to connect to backend fails, give up
	  connecting to the failed node and skip to other node, rather
	  than exiting the process if operating in streaming
	  replication mode and the node is not primary node.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Mark the local status of the failed node to "down".  This
	  will let the primary node be selected as a load balance node
	  and every queries will be sent to the primary node. If
	  there's other healthy standby nodes, one of them will be
	  chosen as the load balance node.
	</para>
	<para>
	  After the session is over, the child process will suicide to
	  not retain the local status.

	  <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> flushes data to network

	  Row" message) to frontend. For example, if 10,000 rows
	  needed to be transfer, 10,000 times write()s are
	  issued. This is pretty expensive. Since after repeating to
	  send row data, "Command Complete" message is sent, it's
	  enough to issue a write() with the command complete
	  message. Also there are unnecessary flushing are in handling
	  the command complete message.

        <para>
        To fix this, The verification mechanism of configuration parameter values is
        reversed, previously the standby nodes used to verify their parameter values
        against the respective values on the master <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> node and when the
        inconsistency was found the FATAL error was thrown, now with this commit the
        verification responsibility is delegated to the master <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> node.
        Now the master node will verify the configuration parameter values of each
        joining standby node against its local values and will produce
        a WARNING message instead of an error in case of a difference.
        This way the nodes having the different configurations will also be allowed to
        join the watchdog cluster and the user has to manually look out for the
        configuration inconsistency warnings in the master <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> log to avoid the
        surprises at the time of <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> master switch over.

        <para>
        The fixes related to extended protocol cases in 3.5.1 broke the case
        of empty query.  In this case backend replies with "empty query
        response" which is same meaning as a command complete message. Problem
        is, when empty query response is received, pgpool does not reset the
        query in progress flag thus keeps on waiting for backend. However,
        backend will not send the ready for query message until it receives a
        sync message. Fix is, resetting the in progress flag after receiving
        the empty query response and reads from frontend expecting it sends a
        sync message.

        The problem was due to a logical mistake in the code for checking the exiting
        child process type when the watchdog is enabled.
        I have also changed the severity of the message from FATAL to LOG, emitted
        for child exits due to max connection reached.

        After receiving X message from frontend, if <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> detects EOF on
        the connection before sending reset query, <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> could wait for
        backend which had not received the reset query. To fix this, if EOF
        received, treat this as FRONTEND_ERROR, rather than ERROR.

        The solution is to report FRONTEND_ERROR instead of simple ERROR when
        pool_flush on front-end socket fails.
