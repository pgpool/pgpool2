 <para>
  Since <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> is a middleware that works between
  <productname>PostgreSQL</> servers and a <productname>PostgreSQL</> database client, so when a client application
  connects to the <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>, <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>
  in turn connects to the <productname>PostgreSQL</> servers using the same credentials to serve the incoming
  client connection. Thus, all the access privileges and restrictions defined for the user in <productname>PostgreSQL</>
  gets automatically applied to all <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> clients, with an exceptions of
  the authentications on <productname>PostgreSQL</> side that depends on the client's IP addresses or hostnames.
  Reason being the connections to the <productname>PostgreSQL</> server are made by <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>
  on behalf of the connecting clients and <productname>PostgreSQL</> server can only see the IP address of the
  <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> server and not that of the actual client.
  Therefore, for the client host based authentications <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> has the
  <literal>pool_hba</literal> mechanism similar to the <literal>pg_hba</literal> mechanism for
  authenticating the incoming client connections.

  <title>The <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename> File</title>

  <indexterm zone="auth-pool-hba-conf">
   <primary>pool_hba.conf</primary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
   Just like the <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> file for <productname>PostgreSQL</>,
   <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> supports a similar client authentication
   function using a configuration file called <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename>.
   <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> installation also includes the sample
   <filename>pool_hba.conf.sample</filename> file in the default configuration directory
   (<literal>"/usr/local/etc"</literal>).
   By default, pool_hba authentication is disabled, and setting <varname>enable_pool_hba</varname>
   to <literal>on</literal> enables it. see the <xref linkend="guc-enable-pool-hba"> configuration parameter.
  </para>

  <para>
   The format of the <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename> file follows very closely <productname>PostgreSQL</>'s <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> format.

   The general format of the <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename> file is
   a set of records, one per line. Blank lines are ignored, as is any
   text after the <literal>#</literal> comment character.
   Records cannot be continued across lines.
   A record is made
   up of a number of fields which are separated by spaces and/or tabs.
   Fields can contain white space if the field value is double-quoted.
   Quoting one of the keywords in a database, user, or address field (e.g.,
   <literal>all</> or <literal>replication</>) makes the word lose its special
   meaning, and just match a database, user, or host with that name.
  </para>

  <para>
   Each record specifies a connection type, a client IP address range
   (if relevant for the connection type), a database name, a user name,
   and the authentication method to be used for connections matching
   these parameters. The first record with a matching connection type,
   client address, requested database, and user name is used to perform
   authentication. There is no <quote>fall-through</> or
   <quote>backup</>: if one record is chosen and the authentication
   fails, subsequent records are not considered. If no record matches,
   access is denied.
  </para>

  <para>
   A record can have one of the following formats
   <synopsis>
    local      <replaceable>database</replaceable>  <replaceable>user</replaceable>  <replaceable>auth-method</replaceable>  <optional><replaceable>auth-options</replaceable></optional>
    host       <replaceable>database</replaceable>  <replaceable>user</replaceable>  <replaceable>CIDR-address</replaceable>  <replaceable>auth-method</replaceable>  <optional><replaceable>auth-options</replaceable></optional>

   The meaning of the fields is as follows:

      <para>
       Specifies the client machine address(es) that this record matches.
       An IP address range is specified using standard numeric notation
       for the range's starting address, then a slash (<literal>/</literal>)
       and a <acronym>CIDR</> mask length.  The mask
       length indicates the number of high-order bits of the client
       IP address that must match.  Bits to the right of this should
       be zero in the given IP address.
       There must not be any white space between the IP address, the

	   <para>
	    To enable PAM authentication, you must create a service-configuration file

  <para>
   Since the <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename> records are examined
   sequentially for each connection attempt, the order of the records is
   significant. Typically, earlier records will have tight connection
   match parameters and weaker authentication methods, while later
   records will have looser match parameters and stronger authentication
   methods. For example, one might wish to use <literal>trust</>
   authentication for local TCP/IP connections but require a password for
   remote TCP/IP connections. In this case a record specifying
   <literal>trust</> authentication for connections from 127.0.0.1 would
   appear before a record specifying password authentication for a wider
   range of allowed client IP addresses.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <para>
    All pool_hba authentication options described in this section are
    about the authentication taking place between a client and the
    <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>.
    A client still has to go through the <productname>PostgreSQL</>'s authentication
    process and must have the <literal>CONNECT</> privilege for the
    database on the backend <productname>PostgreSQL</> server.
   </para>
   <para>
    As far as pool_hba is concerned, it does not matter if a user name
    and/or database name given by a client
    (i.e. <command>psql -U testuser testdb</command>)
    really exists in the backend. pool_hba only cares if a match in the
    <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename> can be found or not.

    This authentication method is the password-based authentication
    methods in which MD-5-hashed password is sent by client.
    Since <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> does not has the visibility
    of <productname>PostgreSQL</>'s database user password and client application only sends
    the MD5-hash of the password, so <literal>md5</literal> authentication

     1- Login as the database's operating system user and type
     <command>"pg_md5 --config-file=path_to_pgpool.conf --md5auth --username=username password"</command>
     user name and <literal>md5</literal> encrypted password are registered
     into pool_passwd.
     If pool_passwd does not exist yet, pg_md5 command will automatically create it for you.
     <note>

   <para>
    This authentication method uses PAM (Pluggable

    default PAM service name is <literal>pgpool</literal>.
    PAM authentication is supported using user information on
    the host where <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> is executed.

    To enable PAM authentication, you need to create a service-configuration

    PAM configuration directory (which is usually at <literal>"/etc/pam.d"</literal>).
    A sample service-configuration file is installed as

   <para>
    GSSAPI is an industry-standard protocol for secure authentication
    defined in RFC 2743.  Currently
    <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> does not support GSSAPI.
    Clients should not use GSSAPI authentication, or should use
    "prefer GSSAPI authentication if possible" option (this is the
    default setting of <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> clients).
    If latter is chosen, <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> requests
    non-GSSAPI authentication to client, and the clients will fall
    back to non-GSSAPI authentication method. Thus, usually users do
    not need to worry about that <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>
    does not accept GSSAPI authentication.
