  <para>
    Since <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> is a middleware that works between
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> servers and
    a <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> database client, so when a
    client application connects to
    the <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>, <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>
    inturn connects to the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> servers
    using the same credentials to serve the incomming client
    connection. Thus, all the access privileges and restrictions defined
    for the user in <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> gets
    automatically applied to all <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>
    clients, with an exceptions of the authentications
    on <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> side that depends on the
    client's IP addresses or host names.  Reason being the connections
    to the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server are made
    by <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> on behalf of the connecting
    clients and <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> server can only
    see the IP address of the
    <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> server and not that of the actual client.
    Therefore, for the client host based authentications <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> has the
    <literal>pool_hba</literal> mechanism similar to the <literal>pg_hba</literal> mechanism for
    authenticating the incomming client connections.

    <para>
      Just like the <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> file for <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>,
      <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> supports a similar client authentication
      function using a configuration file called <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename>.
      <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> installation also includes the sample
      <filename>pool_hba.conf.sample</filename> file in the default
      configuration directory (<literal>"/usr/local/etc"</literal>).
      By default, pool_hba authentication is disabled, and
      setting <varname>enable_pool_hba</varname>
      to <literal>on</literal> enables it. see
      the <xref linkend="guc-enable-pool-hba"> configuration
      parameter.
    </para>

    <para>
      The format of the <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename> file
      follows very
      closely <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename>
      format.
    </para>
    <para>
      The general format of the <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename> file is
      a set of records, one per line. Blank lines are ignored, as is any
      text after the <literal>#</literal> comment character.
      Records cannot be continued across lines.
      A record is made
      up of a number of fields which are separated by spaces and/or tabs.
      Fields can contain white space if the field value is double-quoted.
      Quoting one of the keywords in a database, user, or address field (e.g.,
      <literal>all</literal> or <literal>replication</literal>) makes
      the word lose its special meaning, and just match a database, user, or
      host with that name.
    </para>

    <para>
      Each record specifies a connection type, a client IP address
      range (if relevant for the connection type), a database name, a
      user name, and the authentication method to be used for
      connections matching these parameters. The first record with a
      matching connection type, client address, requested database,
      and user name is used to perform authentication. There is
      no <quote>fall-through</quote> or
      <quote>backup</quote>: if one record is chosen and the authentication
      fails, subsequent records are not considered. If no record matches,
      access is denied.
    </para>

    <para>
      A record can have one of the following formats
      <synopsis>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term><replaceable>address</replaceable></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Specifies the client machine address(es) that this record matches.
	      This field can contain either a host name, an IP address range,
	      or one of the special key words mentioned below.
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      An IP address range is specified using standard numeric notation for
	      the range's starting address, then a slash (<literal>/</literal>)
	      and a <acronym>CIDR</acronym> mask length.
	      The mask length indicates the number of high-order bits of the client
	      IP address that must match. Bits to the right of this should be zero
	      in the given IP address. There must not be any white space between the
	      IP address, the <literal>/</literal>, and the CIDR mask length.
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      Typical examples of an IPv4 address range specified this way are
	      <literal>172.20.143.89/32</literal> for a single host, or
	      <literal>172.20.143.0/24</literal> for a small network, or
	      <literal>10.6.0.0/16</literal> for a larger one.
	      An IPv6 address range might look like <literal>::1/128</literal> for
	      a single host (in this case the IPv6 loopback address) or
	      <literal>fe80::7a31:c1ff:0000:0000/96</literal> for a small network.
	      <literal>0.0.0.0/0</literal> represents all IPv4 addresses, and
	      <literal>::0/0</literal> represents all IPv6 addresses. To specify a
	      single host, use a mask length of 32 for IPv4 or 128 for IPv6.
	      In a network address, do not omit trailing zeroes.
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      An entry given in IPv4 format will match only IPv4 connections, and
	      an entry given in IPv6 format will match only IPv6 connections, even
	      if the represented address is in the IPv4-in-IPv6 range.
	      Note that entries in IPv6 format will be rejected if the system's C
	      library does not have support for IPv6 addresses.
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      You can also write <literal>all</literal> to match any IP address, 
	      <literal>samehost</literal> to match any
	      of the server's own IP addresses, or samenet to match any address in
	      any <literal>subnet</literal> that the server is directly connected to.
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      If a host name is specified (anything that is not an IP address range or
	      a special key word is treated as a host name), that name is compared with
	      the result of a reverse name resolution of the client's IP address
	      (e.g., reverse DNS lookup, if DNS is used). Host name comparisons are
	      case insensitive. If there is a match, then a forward name resolution
	      (e.g., forward DNS lookup) is performed on the host name to check whether
	      any of the addresses it resolves to are equal to the client's IP address.
	      If both directions match, then the entry is considered to match.
	      (The host name that is used in <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename> should be the one that
	      address-to-name resolution of the client's IP address returns, otherwise
	      the line won't be matched. Some host name databases allow associating an
	      IP address with multiple host names, but the operating system will only
	      return one host name when asked to resolve an IP address.)
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      A host name specification that starts with a dot (<literal>.</literal>) matches 
	      a suffix of the actual host name. So <literal>.example.com</literal> would match
	      <literal>foo.example.com</literal> (but not just <literal>example.com</literal>).
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      When host names are specified in <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename>, you should
	      make sure that name resolution is reasonably fast. It can be of advantage to
	      set up a local name resolution cache such as <acronym>nscd</acronym>.
	    </para>

	    <para>
	      This field only applies to host, hostssl, and hostnossl records.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      Specifying the host name in address field is not supported prior to
	      <productname>Pgpool-II </productname><emphasis>V3.7</emphasis>.
	    </para>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term><replaceable>IP-address</replaceable></term>
	  <term><replaceable>IP-mask</replaceable></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      These two fields can be used as an alternative to the 
	      <replaceable>IP-address</replaceable><literal>/</literal>
	      <replaceable>mask-length</replaceable> notation.
	      Instead of specifying the mask length, the actual mask
	      is specified in a separate column.  For
	      example, <literal>255.0.0.0</literal> represents an
	      IPv4 <acronym>CIDR</acronym> mask length
	      of <literal>8</literal>,
	      and <literal>255.255.255.255</literal> represents a
	      <acronym>CIDR</acronym> mask length of 32.

    <para>
      Since the <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename> records are examined
      sequentially for each connection attempt, the order of the records
      is significant. Typically, earlier records will have tight
      connection match parameters and weaker authentication methods, while
      later records will have looser match parameters and stronger
      authentication methods. For example, one might wish to
      use <literal>trust</literal> authentication for local TCP/IP
      connections but require a password for remote TCP/IP connections. In
      this case a record specifying
      <literal>trust</literal> authentication for connections from 127.0.0.1 would
      appear before a record specifying password authentication for a wider
      range of allowed client IP addresses.
    </para>

    <tip>
      <para>
	All pool_hba authentication options described in this section are
	about the authentication taking place between a client and the
	<productname>Pgpool-II</productname>.  A client still has to go
	through the <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s authentication
	process and must have the <literal>CONNECT</literal> privilege for
	the database on the backend <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>
	server.
      </para>
      <para>
	As far as pool_hba is concerned, it does not matter if a user name
	and/or database name given by a client
	(i.e. <command>psql -U testuser testdb</command>)
	really exists in the backend. pool_hba only cares if a match in the
	<filename>pool_hba.conf</filename> can be found or not.
