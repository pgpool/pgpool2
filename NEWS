2.2.8 (urukiboshi) 2012/08/06

      * Version 2.2.8

      It includes various fixes for bugs various bug fixes in 2.2.7.

      * Bug fixes

      - Fix do_error_execute_command() so that it discards responses from
        backend until ErrorResponse received. (Toshihiro Kitagawa)

        Note that we need to preserve non-error responses (i.e. ReadyForQuery)
        and put back them using pool_unread().
        Otherwise, ReadyForQuery response of DEALLOCATE. This could happen if
        PHP PDO used.

      - Fix SimpleForwardToFrontend() so that it reset select_in_transaction
        flag and execute_select flag when bind error occurred while executing
        SELECT. (Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Fix bug with pcp_check_fd()'s timeout handling. (Tatsuo Ishii)

        Per erboles.
          Subject: [Pgpool-general] question about pcp_check_fd
          Date: Sun, 23 May 2010 18:21:41 -0500
          To: pgpool <pgpool-general@pgfoundry.org>

      - Fix buffer overrun problem when pcp password is longer than 32.
        (Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix wait_for_query_response() not to send param status to frontend if
        frontend is NULL. This could happen while processing reset_query_list.
        (Tatsuo Ishii)

2.2.7 (urukiboshi) 2010/04/15

      * Version 2.2.7

      This version enhances displaying error messages when kind
      mismatch error occurs. Also it includes various fixes for bugs
      in 2.2.6 or before as usual.

      * Bug fixes

      - Fix occasional hangup in extend protocol + master/slave mode,
        row mode or connection pool mode. Back patch from 2.3
        tree(Kitagawa)

      - Fix long standing bug since pgpool-II 1.0 which causes
        segfault of pgpool child process. This was caused by
        miscalculation of shmem size in pgpool parent. Bug analysis by
        Kitagawa patch created by Tatsuo

      - Send Parse, Bind, Describe and Close message to only master
        node if operated in explicit transaction and master/slave
        mode(Tatsuo).

      - Emit a log when postmaster goes down(Tatsuo)

      - Fix memory leak in make_persistent_db_connection(Xavier
        Noguer)

      - Do not force replication of DEALLOCATE if operated in
        master/slave mode. Now that pgpool do not execute PARSE in all
        nodes, this was pointless and caused problem (kind mismatch
        when executing DEALLOCATE) (Tatsuo)

      - Fix crash with show pool_status when there many (more than 18)
        DB nodes(Tatsuo)

      - Enhance "kind mismatch" message. If kind is ERROR or NOTICE,
        print the ERROR/NOTICE message to help users to find what's
        going on(Tatsuo)

2.2.6 (urukiboshi) 2009/12/01

	  * Version 2.2.6

	  This version enhances handling of backend weight. Also it allows
	  to use temp tables in master/slave mode. It includes various
	  fixes for bugs in 2.2.5 or before as usual.

	  * Bug fixes

	  - Do not allow to load balance DECLARE, CLOSE, FETCH and
        MOVE. If data gets updated and CLOSE issued after transaction
        commit(i.e. holdbale cursor), this will cause data
        inconsistency since CLOSE is executed one of the severs,
        rather than all(Tatsuo)

	  - In master/slave mode, execute Parse message on only master
        node. In previous versions Parse executed on all nodes, which
        grabbed unneccessary lock(Tatsuo)

	  - Remove init script from all runlevels before uninstall(Devrim)

	  - Fix pgpoo.spec(Devrim)

	  - Do not execute REINDEX DATABASE or SYSTEM, CREATE/DROP TABLE
        SPACE inside a transaction block(Tatsuo)

	  * Enhancements

	  - Allow to change weight by reloading pgool.conf. This will take
        effect for next client sessions(Tatsuo)

	  - Reply with usefull error messages, rather than "server closed
        the connection unexpectedly" when authentication fails(Glyn
        Astill)

	  - Add info to logs when writing to sockets falis to know if it
        was for backend or frontend(Tatsuo)

	  - Do not complain when writing to socket of frontend
        fails(Tatsuo)

	  - Allow to use temp tables in master/slave
        mode. INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE will automatically be sent to
        master only. Still SELECT you need to add /*NO LOAD BALANCE*/
        comment(Tatsuo)

	  - Add temp table test to test/jdbc(Tatsuo)

2.2.5 (urukiboshi) 2009/10/4
	  * Version 2.2.5

	  This version fixes various bugs in 2.2.4 or before.

	  * Bug fixes

	  - Fix connection_count_down(). It decrements the connection
        counter too much in some corner cases and causes online
        recover never completes(Tatsuo)

	  - Detect frontend exiting while waiting for commands complete in
        other cases such as internal locks are issued and Parse
        (Tatsuo)

	  - Fix inifinit loop in reset_backend(Xavier Noguer, Tatsuo)

	  - Fix Parse() to print actual query when it detects kind
        mismatch error(Tatsuo)

	  - Document enhancements(Tatsuo)

2.2.4 (urukiboshi) 2009/8/24
	  * Version 2.2.4

	  This version fixes various bugs in 2.2.3 or before.

	  * Bug fixes

	  - Fix possible bug introduced in pgpool-II 2.2.2.  Load balance
		control variables may remain not be restored and subsequent
		DML/DDL call might sent to only master node(Tatsuo)

	  - Send NOTICE message to frontend periodically if V2 protocol is
		used. This is ifdef out since it affectes visible change to
		applications.  2.2.3 unconditionaly sends param packet to
		client even it uses version 2 protocol, which is apparentlt
		wrong. Also tweak checking period from 1 second to 30 seconds
		since 1 second seems too aggressive(Tatsuo)

	  - Block signals before forking children rather after.  Otherwise
		parent will be killed by failover signal if it receives a
		signal before establishing signal handler(Tatsuo)

	  - Remove unnecessary spaces and tabs at the end of line(Jun Kuriyama)

2.2.3 (urukiboshi) 2009/8/11
	  * Version 2.2.3

	  This version fixes various bugs in 2.2.2 or before.

	  * Bug fixes

	  - Fix child process death if one of backends is not available(Tatsuo).

	  - Fix various parallel query bugs(Yoshiharu Mori)

	  - Fix message corruption for kid mismatch error(Akio Ishida)

	  - Now stetmemt_time works(Tatsuo)

	  - Enhance health checking to detect postmaster stopping by
        SIGSTOP(Tatsuo)

	  - Detect frontend abnormal exiting while waiting for reply from
        backend. This only works with V3 protocol(Tatsuo)

	  - Do not start internal transaction if command is CLUSTER
        without arguments(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix bug with COPY FROM in that backend process remains after
        COPY failed(Tatsuo)

	  * Enhancements

	  - Show last query for extended protocol(Akio Ishida)

	  - Allow to compile sql/pgpool-recovery/pgpool-recovery.c with
        PostgreSQL 8.4(Tatsuo)

2.2.2 (urukiboshi) 2009/5/5
	  * Version 2.2.2

	  This version fixes various bugs in 2.2.1 or before. Please note
	  that an importan fix is made to avoid data incositency risk,
	  which could happen when client does not exit gracely(without
	  sending "X" packet) while pgpool is trying to send data to
	  it. This could happen with all version of pgpool-II.

	  * Bug fixes

	  - Ignore write error on frontend connection. This is needed to
		continue processing with backend, otherwise we risk data
		incositency(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix bug introduced in 2.2.1 (In master slave mode, sometimes
	  	DEALLOCATE fails). If prepared statement reused, pgpool
	  	hangs(Toshihiro)

	  - Fix pgpool crash when SQL command PREPARE and protocol level
        EXECUTE are mixed. The bug was introduced in 2.2(Tatsuo)

	  - Avoid "unexpected EOF on client connection" error in PostgreSQL
        when reset query fails(Tatsuo)
		
2.2.1 (urukiboshi) 2009/4/25
	  * Version 2.2.1

	  This version fixes various bugs in 2.2.

	  * Bug fixes

	  - In master slave mode, sometimes DEALLOCATE fails. This is
		caused by that the first PREPARE was not executed on the
		slave(Toshihiro)

	  - Update pgpool.spec along with related files(Devrim)

	  - Fix inser_lock so that it is ignored when protocol version is
        2(Tatsuo)
		
	  - Remove excessive log messages regarding parameter change notice(Tatsuo)

	  - Add missing files to doc(Tatsuo)

2.2 (urukiboshi) 2009/2/28
	  * Version 2.2

	  This version enhances SERIAL data type handling and on line
	  recovery. Also an important bug, serializable transactions could
	  cause data inconsistency among DB nodes, is fixed. Query
	  cancelation, which never worked since pgpool-II was born, is
	  finally fixed.

	  * New features/enhancements

		- With insert_lock, now a table is locked only if it has
          SERIAL data type and now the default value for insert_lock
          is true(Tatsuo)

		- Start internal transaction other than INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
          and SELECT to keep node consistency(Tatsuo)

		- Add client_idle_limit_in_recovery directive. This will
		  prevent 2nd stage of on line recovery from not going forward
		  by idle clients sitting forever(Tatsuo)

		- Add pid_file_name directive which specifies a path to the
		  file containing pgpool process id. "logdir" is no more used(Tatsuo)

		- Allow to load balance DECLARE, FETCH and CLOSE(Tatsuo)

		- Add -d option to pcp commands(Jun Kuriyama)

		- Enahnce kind mismatch error message to include originarl
          query string(Tatsuo)

	  * Bug fixes

	    - Close all file descriptors when running in daemon mode.
	      Otherwise we inherit sockets from apache when it's
	      started by pgpoolAdmin. This results in that port 80 is
	      occupied for example.  Patch provided by Akio
	      Ishida. Also add chdir("/"). This is always good for
	      daemon programs(Tatsuo)

	    - Allow MD5 authentication in raw mode as stated in docs(Tatsuo)

	    - Check transaction serialization failure error in
	      serializable mode and abort all nodes if so. Otherwise
	      we allow data inconsistency among DB nodes(Tatsuo).

	      See following scenario: (M:master, S:slave)

		  	M:S1:BEGIN;
			M:S2:BEGIN;
			S:S1:BEGIN;
			S:S2:BEGIN;
			M:S1:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
			M:S2:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
			S:S1:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
			S:S2:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
			M:S1:UPDATE t1 SET i = i + 1;
			S:S1:UPDATE t1 SET i = i + 1;
			M:S2:UPDATE t1 SET i = i + 1; <-- blocked
			S:S1:COMMIT;
			M:S1:COMMIT;
			M:S2:ERROR:  could not serialize access due to concurrent update
			S:S2:UPDATE t1 SET i = i + 1; <-- success in UPDATE and data becomes inconsistent!

		- avoid kind mismatch error caused by "SET TRANSACTION
		  ISOLATION LEVEL must be called before any query"(Tatsuo).

		   This could happen in following scenario:

	        M:S1:BEGIN;
            S:S1:BEGIN;
			M:S1:SELECT 1; <-- only sent to MASTER
			M:S1:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
			S:S1:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
			M: <-- error
			S: <-- ok since no previous SELECT is sent. kind mismatch error occurs!

		- Process status display has extra space on FreeeBSD(Jun Kuriyama)

		- Fix incorrect kind mismatch detection case. e.g: BEGIN;
		  BEGIN; (Tatsuo)

	    - If PostgreSQL sends lots of DEBUG message, sometimes pgpool
	      complains:
		  2008-11-08 22:41:53 ERROR: pid 23744: do_command: backend does not
		  return ReadyForQuery. This due to a wrong assumption for the
		  client/server protocol(Tatsuo)

		- Fix the case when sending an erronous query to abort
          transaction. It assumed that after sending an error query,
          always ReadyForQuery came right after that. If some
          debugging or logging verboseness is set, PostgreSQL might
          sends NOTICE before ReadyForQuery(Tatsuo)

		- Query cancelation now works. It never worked since pgpool-II
          was born(Tatsuo)

		- Fix online recovery to wait for failback done before
          allowing to accept connections from clients. It was supposed
          to work like this but actually was not since the day 0 when
          online recovery was born. Without the fix there could be
          potential data inconsistency among DB nodes(Tatsuo)

		- Fix pgpool-II crash after on line recovery. This happens
          after the failback process adds a recovered node which has
          no connection to the node(Tatsuo)

		- Fix pgpool-II errors when postgresql.conf is reloaded. This
          was caused by parameter status packet sent asynchronously
          from backend, which indicates the internal setting of
          backend has been changed(Tatsuo)

	  * Incompatible changes

		- Always fail over and restart all children. Before we do
		  restart only if master has not been changed. This is
		  wrong. If we have trouble with network cable or something,
		  TCP/IP stack keeps on retrying for long time and the only
		  way to prevent it is restarting process(Tatsuo)

		- "logdir" is no more used. Instead use
          "pid_file_name"(Tatsuo)

		- Default value for insert_lock is now true(Tatsuo)

      * Fix process down with UPDATE or DELETE query.(Yoshiyuki)
      * Send a syntax query only to a master node if master_slave is
        true.(Yoshiyuki)

2.0 (hikitsuboshi) 2007/11/16
      * Version 2.0

      * Incompatibility since pgpool-II 1.x
        - the default value for ignore_leading_white_space is now
          true(Yoshiyuki) 
        - replicate_strict is removed. The value is always
          true(Yoshiyuki)

      * General
        - Allow to reload pgpool.conf(Yoshiyuki)
        - The paraser is now compatible with PostgreSQL 8.3(Yoshiyuki)
        - Add new directive "failover_command" to specify command when
          a node is detached(Yoshiyuki)
        - Add new directive "client_idle_limit" to specify the time out since
          the last command is arrived from a client(Tatsuo)
  
      * Replication
        - Always start a new transaction even if the query is not in
          an explicit transaction to enhance the reliabilty of
          replication(Yoshiyuki)
        - Enhance the performance of replication for write
          queries. Now the worst case is 1/2 compared with single DB
          node regardless the number of DB nodes. Previous release
          tends to degrade according to the numer of DB
          nodes(Yoshiyuki)
        - Add "online recovery" which allows to add a DB node and sync
          with other DB nodes without stopping the pgpool
          server(Yoshiyuki)
        - Abort a transaction if INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE reports
          different number of result rows(Yoshiyuki)

          x=# update t set a = a + 1;
          ERROR:  pgpool detected difference of the number of update tuples
          HINT:  check data consistency between master and other db node

        - If the results from DB nodes do not match, select the
          possible correct result by "decide by majority". Previous
          release always trust the result of the master DB
          node(Yoshiyuki)
        - Allow load balance in V2 frontend/backend protocol(Yoshiyuki)

      * Parallel query
        - Allow "partial replication" to enhance the performance of
          the parallel query(Yoshiharu)

1.3 (sohiboshi) 2007/10/23
      * Version 1.3

      * Reject a connection when startup packet length is greater than
        10,000 byte. (Yoshiyuki)
      * Fix invalid memory access when pgpool processed DEALLOCATE
        statement. (Yoshiyuki)
      * Fix hang up in load balance mode. (Yoshiyuki)
        - This was introduced in V1.2.
      * Fix segmentation fault in 64-bit environment when query cache

      * Version 1.2
      * Add new "replicate_select" directive, being the default value
        is false. (Yoshiyuki) 
        - If it is true, SELECT query is replicated. This behavior is
          same as V3.2 or earlier.
      * Improve signal handling. (Yoshiyuki)
        - Occasionaly, zombie processes were remained. Or processes
          were unstable.
      * Fix hang up when SELECT was error inside a transaction
        block. The bug was introduced in V3.3. (Yoshiyuki)
      * Fix PREPARE/EXECUTE handling in master slave mode. (Yoshiyuki)
      * Fix "kind mismatch error" when deadlock error 
      * Fix hang up and SEGV in extended query protocol when a warning
        SQL like "SELECT '\'';" executed. (Yoshiyuki)
      * Fix hang up when postmaster did fast or immediate
        shutdown. (Yoshiyuki)
      * Fix memory leak when connection cache was full. (Yoshiyuki)
