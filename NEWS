3.1 (hatsuiboshi) xxxx/xx/xx

	  * Version 3.1

	  This is the first version of pgpool-II 3.1 series.
	  That is, a "major version up" from 3.0 series.

	  * Incompatible changes

	  - Change the lock method of insert_lock. The previous insert_lock uses
		row locking against the sequence relation, but The current one uses
		row locking against pgpool_catalog.insert_lock table. The reason is
		that PostgreSQL core developers decided to disallow row locking
		against the sequence relation to avoid an internal error which it
		leads. So creating insert_lock table in all databases which are
		accessed via pgpool-II beforehand is required. If does not exist
		insert_lock table, pgpool-II locks the insert target table. This
		behavior is same as pgpool-II 2.2 and 2.3 series. If you want to use
		insert_lock which is compatible with older releases, you can specify
		lock method by configure options: --enable-sequence-lock,
		--enable-table-lock(Kitagawa)

	  - In streaming replication, if delay_threshold is 0 or health checking
		is disabled, the delay checking is not performed. This is the behaviour
		according to a description of the pgpool-II manual. But, so far the
		delay checking was performed even if health checking was disabled
		(Guillaume Lelarge)

	  - Deprecate backend_socket_dir. Instead, if backend_hostname starts
		with '/' it is regarded the as path to Unix domain. If backend_hostname
		is left empty, then default Unix domain path(/tmp) is used. This
		follows the convention of libpq interface. Patch contributed by
		Jehan-Guillaume (ioguix) de Rorthais. Additional fixes by me(Tatsuo)

	  - Now "pgpool_walrecrunning()" was not used. pgpool-II used to consider
		the node that is promoted a primary node using the function. Now,
		pgpool-II waits for completing of the promotion to primary node
		because it did not work as we intended. But we still have a problem
		that pgpool-II waits while recovery_timeout, when there is no primary
		node(Kitagawa)

	  - Add node_id to each PostgreSQL DB node info in the output of
		show pool_nodes. Patch contributed by Jean-Paul Argudo
		(Guillaume Lelarge)

	  * New features

	  - Add syslog support. Patch contributed by Gilles Darold. Review and
		editing by Guillaume Lelarge(Tatsuo)

	  - Adapt application_name introduced in PostgreSQL 9.0. When reusing
		connection, send application_name in the startup packet to backend
		and send parameter status to frontend(Tatsuo)

	  - Add relcache_expire directive to control the expiration of the
		internal system catalog cache. ALTER TABLE might make these
		cache values obsoleted and the new directive will make the risk
		lower(Tatsuo).

	  - Add follow_master_command directive. This directive specifies a
		command to run in master/slave streaming replication only after
		a master failover. Patch contributed by Gilles Darold(Kitagawa)

	  - Add pcp_promote_node command. This command promotes a new master
		node to pgpool-II. This can use in master/slave streaming replication
		only. Patch contributed by Gilles Darold(Kitagawa)

	  - Add pcp_pool_status command which produces similar output of show
		pool_status. Also C API for this command is added. Patch
		contributed by Jehan-Guillaume (ioguix) de Rorthais(Tatsuo)

	  - Add new per backend directive "backend_flag". This controls per
		backend behavior. Currently "ALLOW_TO_FAILOVER" or
		"DISALLOW_TO_FAILOVER" are allowed(Tatsuo)

	  - Add health_check_password directive because the directives of
		helthcheck are used to check replication delay in streaming
		replication mode(Nicolas Thauvin)

	  - Add sr_check_period, sr_check_user and sr_check_password directives.
		These are used for streaming replication delay checking and
		determining primary node(Tatsuo)

	  - Add --username(or -u) option to pg_md5 command. This allows to manage
		users which do not have UNIX accounts. Japanese document change by
		Tatsuo Ishii(Nicolas Thauvin)

	  - Add pgpool_adm functions to pgpool_adm/. These are user-defined
		functions written in C language which work like pcp commands
		(Jehan-Guillaume (ioguix) de Rorthais)

	  - Add Simplified Chinese version of documents(Huang Jian, Sun Peng)

	  - Add SQL files to uninstall functions to sql/(Nicolas Thauvin)

	  * Bug fixes

	  - Fix bug which cannot use the cursors of JDBC driver on standby
		node. The transaction commands come to be sent to all nodes by
		this fix in master/slave mode(Kitagawa)

	  - Fix bug with the handling of empty queries. The empty queries
		come to be handled the same as SELECT queries. This fix allows
		load-balance after the empty query(Kitagawa)

	  - Fix insert_lock so that it works correctly even if the column
		definition such as "DEFAULT nextval(('"x_seq"'::text)::regclass)"
		(Kitagawa)

	  - Fix pcp_attach_node command so that it emits error message while
		doing failover(Kitagawa)

	  - Fix log message which is emitted when pgpool-II cannot parse the
		query in the extended query protocol so that it shows the query
		(Kitagawa)

	  - Fix description about backend_weight inpgpool-II manual. It can
		be changed by reloading pgpool.conf(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix and enhance wording in English tutorial document.
		Fix suggested by Huang Bambo(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix pgpool-regclass() to be compiled in PostgreSQL 8.0 or later.
		7.4 still produces errors(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix possible hangup when using /*NO LOAD BALANCE*/ comment in
		streaming replication(Kitagawa)

	  - Fix hangup when received Flush(H) message or CloseComplete(C)
		message(Kitagawa)

	  - Fix possible hangup that happen for the receiving timing of
		ReadyForQuery(Z) message after pgpool-II connects to backends(Kitagawa)

	  - Add description about parameters for recovery_1st_stage_command and
		recovery_2nd_stage_command(Tatsuo)

	  - Increase size of the internal system catalog cache from 32 to 128.
		This has the effect of reducing "unnamed prepared statement does not
		exist" error(Tatsuo, Kitagawa)

	  - Fix bug with pcp_connect() which causes double free. Patch contributed 
		by Jehan-Guillaume (ioguix) de Rorthais(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix bug with start_recoery() which is apparently wrong usage of
		PQfinish()(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix bug which does not update the node status when reattaching the
		node in raw mode(Guillaume Lelarge)

	  - Fix incorrect calculation of the replication delay in streaming
		replication mode(Tatsuo)

	  - Replace wrong function name "notice_backend_error" with correct one
		"degenerate_backend_set" in the failover log message(Tatsuo)

	  - Remove unnecessary logging at the end of pgpool.conf parsing(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix hangup when using md5 authentication method and running as
		daemon. Patch contributed by Nicolas Thauvin(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix log_per_node_statement so that it prints statements in the
		extended query protocol. This used to work but was broken in 3.0
		(Kitagawa)

	  - Fix incorrect error message which is sent to the frontend when
		client idle time reached client_idle_limit(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix "backend status" variable name correctly in pool_status.
		Replace the space with a '_'(Guillaume Lelarge)

	  * Enhancements

	  - Enhance online recovery in streaming replication mode.
		Now restarting pgpool-II children is avoided when recovery finished. So
		existing sessions can be continued while doing online recovery(Tatsuo)

	  - pcp_attach_node does not diconnect existing sessions in
        streaming replication mode. In other mode, pcp_attache_node
        still disconnects existing sessions(Tatsuo).

	  - Import PostgreSQL 9.0 parser. This allows to use CREATE INDEX with
		implicit index name, which is new in 9.0. Patch contributed by
		Akio Ishida(Tatsuo)

	  - Allow to use regular expressions in black and white function list.
		Patch contributed by Gilles Darold. Patch reviewd by Guillaume Lelarge
		(Tatsuo)

	  - Reorganize pgpool.conf sample files so that they are easier to read
		(Gleu)

	  - Add <a name="..."> tags into all parameters in the pgpool-II user
		manual(Haruka Takatsuka)

	  - Enhance online recovery documents in streaming replication(Tatsuo)

	  - Change the function to check the replication delay in streaming
		replication mode. Currently, pgpool uses
		pg_last_xlog_replay_location() instead of
		pg_last_xlog_receive_location(). Fix suggested by Anton Yuzhaninov
		(Tatsuo)

	  - Allow time stamp rewriting to work with arbitrary expression in
		default value of a column. Before we detected anything including
		now() then simply replaced it to now(). This will lead to wrong
		rewriting of default value. for example, timezone('utc'::text, now()).
		Note that, however, this only adopts to simple queries. Extended
		protocols(for example Java, PHP PDO) or SQL "PREPARE" still remain
		same(Tatsuo)

	  - Enhance the error message which is emitted when failed to check
		replication delay(Nicolas Thauvin)

	  - Change error message "do_md5: read_password_packet failed" into debug
		level(Kitagawa)

	  - Add currval() and lastval() to black_function_list of sample
		configuration files. If they are load balanced, currval() or
		lastval() may be called before the result of nextval() or setval()
		is propagated to slaves(Tatsuo)

	  - Allow to compile pgpool-regclass() against PostgreSQL 9.1(Tatsuo)

	  - Update and sync pgpool-II manuals of English version and Japanese
		version(Tatsuo)

3.0.3 (umiyameboshi) 2011/02/23

	  * Version 3.0.3

	  This version fixes various bugs since 3.0.1. Please note that
	  3.0.2 was canceled due to a packaging problem.

	  * Incompatible changes

	  - Now installing C function "pgpool_walrecrunning()" is recommended
		if you plan to use streaming replication mode.
		This is necessary for better use of online recovery in the mode.
		Also new variable "%P" can be used in the online recovery script.
		If you do not install the function, these functionalities cannot be used(Tatsuo).

	  - In raw mode if there's only one DB node and if a problem arises
		with the DB node, it will be brought to down status. However if
		the DB node goes into good condition again, you can use the DB
		node without restarting pgpool. This change has been included in
		3.0, but did not work(Tatsuo, Kitagawa)

	  * Bug fixes

	  - Fix non portable code in password authentication.
		Bug report from a FreeBSD user(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix bug that insert_lock locks all rows in user table
		(Tatsuo, Kitagawa)

	  - Fix bug with password authentication. If user name is 32 bytes
		long, pgpool child segfaults.(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix bug with md5 authentication. If raw mode or number of
		backend is 1, pgpool child segfaults. Patch contributed by
		Rob Shepherd(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix long standing bug with timestamp rewriting against array
		and complex types. Patch contributed by Akio Ishida(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix bug that debug_level directive doesn't work. Patch
		contributed by Gilles Darold(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix possible crash of pgpool child while doing failover(Kitagawa)

	  - Fix white/black_function_list so that it works correctly when user
		calls function with schema name(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix bug that DROP DATABASE fails by connection cache(Kitagawa)

	  - Fix bug that failover fails in raw mode(Kitagawa)

	  - Fix possible termination of pgpool child when both simple query
		protocol and extended query protocol are used in one session
		(Kitagawa)

	  - Fix possible hang up when an error occurs while using extended
		query protocol(Kitagawa)

	  - Fix pgpool-regclass() so that it doesn't use PG_TRY/CATCH.
		It appeared that using PG_TRY/CATCH is not safe, sometimes backend
		dies with PANIC:  ERRORDATA_STACK_SIZE exceeded.(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix bug that select query isn't sent to master node when it meets
		the following conditions(Kitagawa)
		- in MASTER/SLAVE mode
		- use extended query protocol
		- started transaction explicitly
		- after write queries

	  - Fix bug with load_balance that JDBC driver sends BEGIN to master node
		many times(Kitagawa)

	  - Fix pool_status so that failback_command and fail_over_on_backend_error
		show correct values(Kitagawa)

	  - Remove parameters from pool_status: recovery_password,
		system_db_password(Kitagawa)

	  - Fix online recovery problem in the streaming replication
		mode(Tatsuo). Consider following scenario. Suppose node 0 is
		the initial primary server and 1 is the initial standby
		server.

		1) Node 0 going down and node 1 promotes to new primary.
		2) Recover node 0 as new standby.
		3) pgpool-II assumes that node 0 is the new primary.

		This problem happens because pgpool-II regarded unconditionally
		the youngest node to be the primary. pgpool-II 3.0.3 now checks
		each node by using pgpool_walrecrunning() to see if it is a
		actually primary or not and is able to avoid the problem and
		regards node as standby correctly. Also you can use new
		variable "%P" to be used in the recovery script.  If you do
		not install the function, the above problem is not resolved.

	  - Fix backend complaining "unexpected EOF on client connection"
        while doing failover in streaming replication mode(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix pgpool crashes when all backends go down(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix replication delay checking so that it does not keep persistent
		connection to backends. Because the persistent connection may
		become bogus if a node down and then wake up between replication
		delay checking period(Tatsuo)

	  - Rewrite and review english document(Marc Cousin, Gleu)

	  * Enhancements

	  - Emit log if particular backend is down status while reading
		the status file(Tatsuo)

	  - Emit error message if an error occurred by the query that
		pgpool executed(Tatsuo)

	  - Add sql directories main Makefile(Tatsuo)

3.0.1 (umiyameboshi) 2010/10/19

	  * Version 3.0.1

	  This version fixes various bug in 3.0.

	  * Bug fixes

	  - Fix bug with md5 auth. If there's more than 1 servers to be
		authenticated, it segfaults(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix bug that a child process crashes when clients execute a query
		contains syntax error in extended query protocol(Kitagawa)

	  - Fix bug with handling of portal information, it terminates
		a child process(Kitagawa)

	  - Fix hungup when a query sent to one node caused an error
		in extended query protocol(Kitagawa)

	  - Fix typo in English doc. Patch contributed by Asaf Ohaion(Tatsuo)

3.0 (umiyameboshi) 2010/09/10

	  * Version 3.0

	  This is the first version of pgpool-II 3.0 series.
	  That is, a "major version up" from 2.2 or 2.3 series.

	  The biggest news is, this version adapts to PostgreSQL 9.0's new
	  feature: Streaming Replication/Hot Standby. Streaming
	  replication can be used as a sub mode of master slave
	  mode. Master slave mode itself heavily enhanced:

	  - SELECTs in explicit transactions can be load balanced

	  - In extended protocol, PARSE/BIND/DESCRIBE messages are sent to
        the node which execute EXECUTE message, not all node. This
        will reduce lock contentions.

	  - Auto start of transaction happens only when it needed.

	  - Temporary tables can be used safely.

	  - SELECT which calls functions possibly write to database
        executes on master(primary)
	  
	  Also many new features are added and major refactoring has been
	  made to the internal structure of pgpoo-II. For example, in
	  replication mode, SELECTs calling functions possibly write to
	  database will not allow to load balance.

	  * New features

	  - Online recovery can be used with master/slave/streaming
        replication mode(Tatsuo)

	  - New directive "delay_threshold" is added to monitor
        replication delay in master/slave/streaming replication
        mode. If replication delay is too much, SELECTs are not load
        balanced(Tatsuo)

	  - show pool_status shows replication delay in
        master/slave/streaming replication mode(Tatsuo)

	  - New directive "log_standby_delay" is added to control logging of
        replication delay in master/slave/streaming replication
        mode(Tatsuo)

	  - When insert_lock is enabled and the table includes SERIAL data
        type, issue row lock on the sequence table. Before we issues
        table lock. Problem is, the table lock conflicts with auto
        vacuum and sometimes caused excessive lock waiting(Tatsuo)

	  - Add support for more "SHOW" commands: pool_nodes,
		pool_processes, pool_pools, and pool_version(Guillaume Lelarge)

	  - Backend process id and whether frontend connects to this
        connection pool or not are added to pcp_proc_info's
        output(Tatsuo)

	  - "Gracefuly detach" option is added to pcp_detatch_node. With
        this option, pcp_detatch_node waits until all frontends
        disconnected(Tatsuo)

      - New directive "white_function_list" and "black_function_list"
        are added to register functions those do not or do write to
        database(Tatsuo)

      - In master/slave mode, SELECTs to system catalogs executes only
        on master/primary(Tatsuo)

      - In master/slave mode, SELECTs to temporary table executes only
        on master/primary(Tatsuo)

	  - In master/slave mode, write queries outside of explicit
        transactions no longer trigger to start internal
        transaction(Tatsuo)

	  - In master/slave mode, SELECTs inside explicit transactions are
        load balanced(Tatsuo, Kitagawa)

	  - In master/slave mode, commands are no longer sent to all DB
        nodes. This will prevent unnecessary locking(Tatsuo, Kitagawa)

	  - New command option adds to ignore the status file when
        starting up(Tatsuo)

	  - Supports PostgreSQL 9.0's new VACUUM syntax(Tatsuo)

	  - New directive "failover_if_affected_tuples_mismatch" controls
        the behavior when number of result rows of
        INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE are differ(Tatsuo)

	  - When number of result rows of INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE are
        differ, each number are logged(Tatsuo)

	  - md5 authentication is supported in replication mode and
        master/slave mode(Tatsuo)

	  - Allow to force to move to online recovery second stage even
        there are connecting frontends(Tatsuo)

	  - If there's only one DB node and it triggers failover,
        pgpool-II will automatically connects if the DB node coming
        up(Tatsuo)

	  - Pcp commands supports long options(Guillaume Lelarge)

	  - New directive "debug_level" added to control the debug message
        logging(Tatsuo)

	  - Allow to use various boolean representations as PostgreSQL in
        pgpool.conf(Kitagawa)

	  - New C language function pgpool_switch_xlog for online recovery
	    added(Kitagawa)

	  - New C language function pgpool_regclass added to avoid a trouble
	    about handling of duplicate table names in different schema(Tatsuo)

	  * Bug fixes

	  - Do not rewrite statement which accesses columns having now()
		etc. as the default value but the data type are not timestamp
		etc.  Otherwise we have an error in DMLs(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix timestamp rewriting not to omit schema qualification(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix bug with timeout handling in pcp commands(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix SSL hang when large amount of data transfered(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix failover when there's only one DB node(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix bug with postmaster start check in online recovery.
		Before it continued infinitely to try to connect to postmaster
		if the first attempt failed(Tatsuo)

2.3.3 (tomiteboshi) 2010/04/23

	  * Version 2.3.3

	  This version fixes various bugs since 2.3.2.2.

	  * Incompatible changes

	  - Please note that this version of pgpool consumes more shared
		memory than before. If you encounter problems when starting up
		pgpool, please look into pgpool log. If you find messages
		something like "could not create shared memory segment: Cannot
		allocate memory", please increase the shared memory on your
		system.

	  - Now parallel mode requires replication mode turned
        on. parallel mode without replication mode turned on has been
        broken since pgpool-II was born anyway(Kitagawa)

	  - Change default value for insert_lock to false since there's no
		point in turning this on in master/slave mode. Fix suggested by
		Fujii Masao(Tatsuo)

	  * Newly added documents

	  - README.online-recovery, which is an internal document of
        online recovery, added(Tatsuo)

	  * Bug fixes

	  - Fix long standing bug since pgpool-II 1.0 which causes
		segfault of pgpool child process.  This was caused by
		miscalculation of shmem size in pgpool parent. Bug analysis by
		Kitagawa patch created by Tatsuo

	  - Add restriction for parallel mode(Kitagawa)
		- The Natural Join is not supported
		- The USING CLAUSE is converted to ON CLAUSE by query rewrite
		  process

	  - Fix possible crash during rewriting JOIN syntax that have
        USING in parallel query mode(Kitagawa)

		This fix is supporting such as following JOIN syntax.

		 example:
		 - SELECT * FROM a JOIN b USING (aid) JOIN c USING (cid);
		 - SELECT * FROM a JOIN b USING (aid) JOIN c USING (cid) JOIN d USING (did)

	  - Fix parallel query so that it can parse INSERT statements that
		have current_time before a partitioning key column(Kitagawa)

	  - Fix SimpleForwardToBackend() so that pgpool doesn't keep
		waiting for reply from a backend, when clients using the
		extended query protocol cause a command error such as bind
		error. This bug occur in master/slave, raw, and connection
		pool mode.  This fix is, sending SYNC message to recover error
		after command error(Kiatagawa)

	  - Fix SIGINT/SIGQUIT is ignored if pgpool child is in
		select(). In this case pgpool retries select() thus the signal
		is ignored(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix connect_inet_domain_socket_by_port/
		connect_unix_domain_socket_by_port so that they check if
		SIGTERM/SIGINT/SIGQUIT signal has been delivered.  Per bug
		report from Daniel Codina(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix possible crash during creating "kind mismatch" error
		message. This used to work but was broken in 2.3.2(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix bug with healh checking. If a network problem such as
		unplugged wire happens while calling connect(), health
		checking does not work since
		connect_unix_domain_socket()/connect_inet_domain_socket() do
		retry if connect() is interrupted by ALARM signal. Added new
		retry argument which controls the retrying behavior to those
		functions.  Per bug report and problem analysis by Daniel
		Codina(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix enbug in 2.3.2.2 with time stamp rewriting in
		SimpleForwardToBackend. Per bug report from Bugtrack #1010771.
		Report from Peter Pramberge(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix rewriting "*" in paralell query.  Patch conributed by
        sho-san(Kitagawa)

	  - Fix connect_inet_domain_socket_by_port() so that it print out
		error message by using hstrerror(), rather than
		strerror()(Tatsuo)

2.3.2.2 (tomiteboshi) 2010/02/22

	  * Version 2.3.2.2

	  This version fixes various bug in 2.3.x.

	  - When rewriting timestamp in extended query, it allocated less
        than what it actually needed. This causes random problematic
        behavior, typically "message: invalid string in message" error
        in backend(Tatsuo).

	  - In extended query, if one of parameters contains NULL, ppool
        crashes(Tatsuo).

	  - If in previous status file all nodes were marked down status,
		it is regarded that this file is bogus. This will prevent "all
		node down" syndrome(Tatsuo).

2.3.2.1 (tomiteboshi) 2010/02/11

	  * Version 2.3.2.1

	  This version fixes bug in 2.3.x. It is identfied that
	  pgpool-II 2.3.x has a problem with erroneous query
	  processing(Akio Ishida).

2.3.2 (tomiteboshi) 2010/02/07

	  * Version 2.3.2

	  This version includes various fixes for bugs in 2.3.1 or before.
	  All 2.3.x users are encouraged to upgrade to 2.3.2 as soon as
	  possible.

	  Also this version enables long awaited SSL support and large
	  object replication support.

	  * Enhancements

	  - SSL support(Sean Finney)

	  - Large object replication support. You need PostgreSQL 8.1 or
        later, however(Tatsuo)

	  - Emit statement log when error or notice message comes from
		query parsing process. This is usefull because PostgreSQL does
		not log particular statement if the error was detected
		*before* raw parser get executed.  This typlically happens
		when encoding error was found(Tatsuo)

	  - Display original query to log if kind mismatch error was
        caused by DEALLOCATE(Tatsuo)

	  - While health checking and recovery use postgres database if
		possible.  If postgres database does not exist, use template1
		as it stands now.  While connecting template1, certain
		commands, for example DROP DATABASE cannot used. Using postgres
		database allows to use these commands while recovery(Tatsuo)

	  * Bug fixes

	  - Fix errors in timestamp rewriting which occasionaly cause
		broken packet sentto slave nodes(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix errors when timestamp rewriting is used with V2
        protocol(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

	  - Propagate Bind, Describe and Close messages to only master
        node if running in master/slave and in transaction (Tatsuo)

	  - Fix do_child() so that check_stop_request() exits immediately
		when smart shutdown signal has been sent.  This has been used
		to work in 2.2(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

	  - Fix ProcessFrontendResponse not to accept invalid frotend
        packet(Xavier Noguer)

	  - Use %dz for sizeof in fprintf for more portability(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix compiler warnings(Tatsuo)

	  - Do not force replication of DEALLOCATE if operated in
		master/slave mode. Now that pgpool do not execute PARSE in all
		nodes, this was pointless and caused problem (kind mismatch
		when executing DEALLOCATE)(Tatuso)

2.3.1 (tomiteboshi) 2009/12/18

	  * Version 2.3.1

	  This version includes various fixes for bugs in 2.3 or before.
	  All 2.3 users are encouraged to upgrade to 2.3.1 as soon as
	  possible.

	  * Bug fixes

	  - If all of following conditions met, incorrect data is written
        to DB(Tatsuo)

		- pgpool is running in replication mode
		- pgpool is running on 64bit OS
		- INSERT or UPDATE are used which explicitly include now(),
		- CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME. Or the target
		- Table's default value use above functions
	    - The SQL statement inclludes out of 32bit
		  integer value(-2147483648 to 2147483647 in decimal)

		Example SQL: INSERT INTO t1(id, regdate) VALUES(98887776655,
		NOW());

	  - Fix crush in case of more than 18 DB nodes are used(Tatsuo)

	  - Enhance kind mismatch error message. If kind is ERROR or
        NOTICE, the error or notice message from PostgreSQL will be printed(Tatsuo)

2.3 (tomiteboshi) 2009/12/07

	  * Version 2.3

	  This version enhances replication, especially CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
	  CURRENT_DATE, now() etc. now can be properly replicated. Also
	  perforance of replication when num_init_children == 1 is
	  enhanced. Pgpool-II now records the status of down nodes, and
	  remember when it restarts to ensure that keep the node status as
	  before. Also some logs are enhanced and more fine fail over
	  controls are added. Please note that pgpool-II 2.3 includes all
	  of enhancements and fixes of pgpool-II 2.2.1 to 2.2.6.

	  * Incompatibilities from 2.2.x

	  - pgpool_status file is created under logdir. So you need to
        give write permission to the directory so that pgpool-II can
        read/write pgpool_status file.

	  * Enhancements

	  - Enable proper replication of results of temporal functions
        (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_DATE, now() etc.). Now
        applications can execute INSERT/UPDATE tables which include
        defaut values using those temporal functions. There are small
        limitations. See restriction sections of docs for more
        details (Akio Ishida)

	  - Use PostgreSQL 8.4's SQL parser(Akio Ishida)

	  - Enhance the performance 20% to 100% of replication when
		num_init_children == 1(Tatsuo)

	  - Add new directive log_per_node_statement which is similar to
        log_statement except that prints info for each DB node to make
        it easier which query is sent to which DB node(Tatsuo)

	  - Add new directive fail_over_on_backend_error to control the
		 behaviro of fail over(Tatsuo)

	  - Record DB node status and remember when pgpool-II restarts(Tatsuo)

	  - EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE for SELECT query are now load
        balanced. This will prevent unwanted kind mismatch errors when
        EXPLAIN produces slightly different plan(Tatsuo)

	  - Enhance CSS of pgpool-ja.html(Tatsuo)

	  - Add sample configuration file for replication mode and
        master/slave mode(Tatsuo)

	 - Add test for temporal data(Akio Ishida)

2.2.6 (urukiboshi) 2009/12/01

	  * Version 2.2.6

	  This version enhances handling of backend weight. Also it allows
	  to use temp tables in master/slave mode. It includes various
	  fixes for bugs in 2.2.5 or before as usual.

	  * Bug fixes

	  - Do not allow to load balance DECLARE, CLOSE, FETCH and
        MOVE. If data gets updated and CLOSE issued after transaction
        commit(i.e. holdbale cursor), this will cause data
        inconsistency since CLOSE is executed one of the severs,
        rather than all(Tatsuo)

	  - In master/slave mode, execute Parse message on only master
        node. In previous versions Parse executed on all nodes, which
        grabbed unneccessary lock(Tatsuo)

	  - Remove init script from all runlevels before uninstall(Devrim)

	  - Fix pgpoo.spec(Devrim)

	  - Do not execute REINDEX DATABASE or SYSTEM, CREATE/DROP TABLE
        SPACE inside a transaction block(Tatsuo)

	  * Enhancements

	  - Allow to change weight by reloading pgool.conf. This will take
        effect for next client sessions(Tatsuo)

	  - Reply with usefull error messages, rather than "server closed
        the connection unexpectedly" when authentication fails(Glyn
        Astill)

	  - Add info to logs when writing to sockets falis to know if it
        was for backend or frontend(Tatsuo)

	  - Do not complain when writing to socket of frontend
        fails(Tatsuo)

	  - Allow to use temp tables in master/slave
        mode. INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE will automatically be sent to
        master only. Still SELECT you need to add /*NO LOAD BALANCE*/
        comment(Tatsuo)

	  - Add temp table test to test/jdbc(Tatsuo)

2.2.5 (urukiboshi) 2009/10/4
	  * Version 2.2.5

	  This version fixes various bugs in 2.2.4 or before.

	  * Bug fixes

	  - Fix connection_count_down(). It decrements the connection
        counter too much in some corner cases and causes online
        recover never completes(Tatsuo)

	  - Detect frontend exiting while waiting for commands complete in
        other cases such as internal locks are issued and Parse
        (Tatsuo)

	  - Fix inifinit loop in reset_backend(Xavier Noguer, Tatsuo)

	  - Fix Parse() to print actual query when it detects kind
        mismatch error(Tatsuo)

	  - Document enhancements(Tatsuo)

2.2.4 (urukiboshi) 2009/8/24
	  * Version 2.2.4

	  This version fixes various bugs in 2.2.3 or before.

	  * Bug fixes

	  - Fix possible bug introduced in pgpool-II 2.2.2.  Load balance
		control variables may remain not be restored and subsequent
		DML/DDL call might sent to only master node(Tatsuo)

	  - Send NOTICE message to frontend periodically if V2 protocol is
		used. This is ifdef out since it affectes visible change to
		applications.  2.2.3 unconditionaly sends param packet to
		client even it uses version 2 protocol, which is apparentlt
		wrong. Also tweak checking period from 1 second to 30 seconds
		since 1 second seems too aggressive(Tatsuo)

	  - Block signals before forking children rather after.  Otherwise
		parent will be killed by failover signal if it receives a
		signal before establishing signal handler(Tatsuo)

	  - Remove unnecessary spaces and tabs at the end of line(Jun Kuriyama)

2.2.3 (urukiboshi) 2009/8/11
	  * Version 2.2.3

	  This version fixes various bugs in 2.2.2 or before.

	  * Bug fixes

	  - Fix child process death if one of backends is not available(Tatsuo).

	  - Fix various parallel query bugs(Yoshiharu Mori)

	  - Fix message corruption for kid mismatch error(Akio Ishida)

	  - Now stetmemt_time works(Tatsuo)

	  - Enhance health checking to detect postmaster stopping by
        SIGSTOP(Tatsuo)

	  - Detect frontend abnormal exiting while waiting for reply from
        backend. This only works with V3 protocol(Tatsuo)

	  - Do not start internal transaction if command is CLUSTER
        without arguments(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix bug with COPY FROM in that backend process remains after
        COPY failed(Tatsuo)

	  * Enhancements

	  - Show last query for extended protocol(Akio Ishida)

	  - Allow to compile sql/pgpool-recovery/pgpool-recovery.c with
        PostgreSQL 8.4(Tatsuo)

2.2.2 (urukiboshi) 2009/5/5
	  * Version 2.2.2

	  This version fixes various bugs in 2.2.1 or before. Please note
	  that an importan fix is made to avoid data incositency risk,
	  which could happen when client does not exit gracely(without
	  sending "X" packet) while pgpool is trying to send data to
	  it. This could happen with all version of pgpool-II.

	  * Bug fixes

	  - Ignore write error on frontend connection. This is needed to
		continue processing with backend, otherwise we risk data
		incositency(Tatsuo)

	  - Fix bug introduced in 2.2.1 (In master slave mode, sometimes
	  	DEALLOCATE fails). If prepared statement reused, pgpool
	  	hangs(Toshihiro)

	  - Fix pgpool crash when SQL command PREPARE and protocol level
        EXECUTE are mixed. The bug was introduced in 2.2(Tatsuo)

	  - Avoid "unexpected EOF on client connection" error in PostgreSQL
        when reset query fails(Tatsuo)
		
2.2.1 (urukiboshi) 2009/4/25
	  * Version 2.2.1

	  This version fixes various bugs in 2.2.

	  * Bug fixes

	  - In master slave mode, sometimes DEALLOCATE fails. This is
		caused by that the first PREPARE was not executed on the
		slave(Toshihiro)

	  - Update pgpool.spec along with related files(Devrim)

	  - Fix inser_lock so that it is ignored when protocol version is
        2(Tatsuo)
		
	  - Remove excessive log messages regarding parameter change notice(Tatsuo)

	  - Add missing files to doc(Tatsuo)

2.2 (urukiboshi) 2009/2/28
	  * Version 2.2

	  This version enhances SERIAL data type handling and on line
	  recovery. Also an important bug, serializable transactions could
	  cause data inconsistency among DB nodes, is fixed. Query
	  cancelation, which never worked since pgpool-II was born, is
	  finally fixed.

	  * New features/enhancements

		- With insert_lock, now a table is locked only if it has
          SERIAL data type and now the default value for insert_lock
          is true(Tatsuo)

		- Start internal transaction other than INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
          and SELECT to keep node consistency(Tatsuo)

		- Add client_idle_limit_in_recovery directive. This will
		  prevent 2nd stage of on line recovery from not going forward
		  by idle clients sitting forever(Tatsuo)

		- Add pid_file_name directive which specifies a path to the
		  file containing pgpool process id. "logdir" is no more used(Tatsuo)

		- Allow to load balance DECLARE, FETCH and CLOSE(Tatsuo)

		- Add -d option to pcp commands(Jun Kuriyama)

		- Enahnce kind mismatch error message to include originarl
          query string(Tatsuo)

	  * Bug fixes

	    - Close all file descriptors when running in daemon mode.
	      Otherwise we inherit sockets from apache when it's
	      started by pgpoolAdmin. This results in that port 80 is
	      occupied for example.  Patch provided by Akio
	      Ishida. Also add chdir("/"). This is always good for
	      daemon programs(Tatsuo)

	    - Allow MD5 authentication in raw mode as stated in docs(Tatsuo)

	    - Check transaction serialization failure error in
	      serializable mode and abort all nodes if so. Otherwise
	      we allow data inconsistency among DB nodes(Tatsuo).

	      See following scenario: (M:master, S:slave)

		  	M:S1:BEGIN;
			M:S2:BEGIN;
			S:S1:BEGIN;
			S:S2:BEGIN;
			M:S1:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
			M:S2:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
			S:S1:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
			S:S2:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
			M:S1:UPDATE t1 SET i = i + 1;
			S:S1:UPDATE t1 SET i = i + 1;
			M:S2:UPDATE t1 SET i = i + 1; <-- blocked
			S:S1:COMMIT;
			M:S1:COMMIT;
			M:S2:ERROR:  could not serialize access due to concurrent update
			S:S2:UPDATE t1 SET i = i + 1; <-- success in UPDATE and data becomes inconsistent!

		- avoid kind mismatch error caused by "SET TRANSACTION
		  ISOLATION LEVEL must be called before any query"(Tatsuo).

		   This could happen in following scenario:

	        M:S1:BEGIN;
            S:S1:BEGIN;
			M:S1:SELECT 1; <-- only sent to MASTER
			M:S1:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
			S:S1:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
			M: <-- error
			S: <-- ok since no previous SELECT is sent. kind mismatch error occurs!

		- Process status display has extra space on FreeeBSD(Jun Kuriyama)

		- Fix incorrect kind mismatch detection case. e.g: BEGIN;
		  BEGIN; (Tatsuo)

	    - If PostgreSQL sends lots of DEBUG message, sometimes pgpool
	      complains:
		  2008-11-08 22:41:53 ERROR: pid 23744: do_command: backend does not
		  return ReadyForQuery. This due to a wrong assumption for the
		  client/server protocol(Tatsuo)

		- Fix the case when sending an erronous query to abort
          transaction. It assumed that after sending an error query,
          always ReadyForQuery came right after that. If some
          debugging or logging verboseness is set, PostgreSQL might
          sends NOTICE before ReadyForQuery(Tatsuo)

		- Query cancelation now works. It never worked since pgpool-II
          was born(Tatsuo)

		- Fix online recovery to wait for failback done before
          allowing to accept connections from clients. It was supposed
          to work like this but actually was not since the day 0 when
          online recovery was born. Without the fix there could be
          potential data inconsistency among DB nodes(Tatsuo)

		- Fix pgpool-II crash after on line recovery. This happens
          after the failback process adds a recovered node which has
          no connection to the node(Tatsuo)

		- Fix pgpool-II errors when postgresql.conf is reloaded. This
          was caused by parameter status packet sent asynchronously
          from backend, which indicates the internal setting of
          backend has been changed(Tatsuo)

	  * Incompatible changes

		- Always fail over and restart all children. Before we do
		  restart only if master has not been changed. This is
		  wrong. If we have trouble with network cable or something,
		  TCP/IP stack keeps on retrying for long time and the only
		  way to prevent it is restarting process(Tatsuo)

		- "logdir" is no more used. Instead use
          "pid_file_name"(Tatsuo)

		- Default value for insert_lock is now true(Tatsuo)

      * Version 2.0.1
      * Fix process down with UPDATE or DELETE query.(Yoshiyuki)
      * Send a syntax query only to a master node if master_slave is
        true.(Yoshiyuki)

2.0 (hikitsuboshi) 2007/11/16
      * Version 2.0

      * Incompatibility since pgpool-II 1.x
        - the default value for ignore_leading_white_space is now
          true(Yoshiyuki) 
        - replicate_strict is removed. The value is always
          true(Yoshiyuki)

      * General
        - Allow to reload pgpool.conf(Yoshiyuki)
        - The paraser is now compatible with PostgreSQL 8.3(Yoshiyuki)
        - Add new directive "failover_command" to specify command when
          a node is detached(Yoshiyuki)
        - Add new directive "client_idle_limit" to specify the time out since
          the last command is arrived from a client(Tatsuo)
  
      * Replication
        - Always start a new transaction even if the query is not in
          an explicit transaction to enhance the reliabilty of
          replication(Yoshiyuki)
        - Enhance the performance of replication for write
          queries. Now the worst case is 1/2 compared with single DB
          node regardless the number of DB nodes. Previous release
          tends to degrade according to the numer of DB
          nodes(Yoshiyuki)
        - Add "online recovery" which allows to add a DB node and sync
          with other DB nodes without stopping the pgpool
          server(Yoshiyuki)
        - Abort a transaction if INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE reports
          different number of result rows(Yoshiyuki)

          x=# update t set a = a + 1;
          ERROR:  pgpool detected difference of the number of update tuples
          HINT:  check data consistency between master and other db node

        - If the results from DB nodes do not match, select the
          possible correct result by "decide by majority". Previous
          release always trust the result of the master DB
          node(Yoshiyuki)
        - Allow load balance in V2 frontend/backend protocol(Yoshiyuki)

      * Parallel query
        - Allow "partial replication" to enhance the performance of
          the parallel query(Yoshiharu)

1.3 (sohiboshi) 2007/10/23
      * Version 1.3

      * Version 1.2
      * Add new "replicate_select" directive, being the default value
        is false. (Yoshiyuki) 
        - If it is true, SELECT query is replicated. This behavior is
          same as V3.2 or earlier.
      * Improve signal handling. (Yoshiyuki)
        - Occasionaly, zombie processes were remained. Or processes
          were unstable.
      * Fix hang up when SELECT was error inside a transaction
        block. The bug was introduced in V3.3. (Yoshiyuki)
