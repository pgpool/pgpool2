                                Release Notes

===============================================================================
3.0 Series (2010/09/10 - )
===============================================================================

                        3.0.19 (umiyameboshi) 2015/07/24

* Version 3.0.19

    This is a bugfix release against pgpool-II 3.0.18.

    __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

    - Fix "cannot find xlog functions" error in pgpool-recovery
      (Muhammad Usama)
      
      The argument data type of PostgreSQL's pg_xlogfile_name() function
      has been changed from text to pg_lsn since PostgreSQL 9.4. And
      pgpool-recovery was still trying to locate the function by old
      signature.

    - Do not send a query for checking insert lock in non replication mode
      with extended query (Tatsuo Ishii)

===============================================================================

                        3.0.18 (umiyameboshi) 2015/04/08

* Version 3.0.18

    This is a bugfix release against pgpool-II 3.0.17.

    __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

    - Enlarge POOLCONFIG_MAXDESCLEN to 80 (Tatsuo Ishii)
      
      This is used in show pool_status command and limits the length of
      parameter description.  Unfortunately recovery_timeout description is
      64 chars, which is 1 byte longer than former definition of the macro.

    - Support SSL certificate chains in the certificate file for incoming
      frontend connections (Muhammad Usama)

    - Fix a problem with pcp_detach_node about graceful node detach (Muhammad Usama)
      
      When graceful node detach is requested gracefully, pcp_detach_node should
      check if it is allowed to process detach_node command on the particular
      node before blocking the incoming connections and closing the existing
      connections.

===============================================================================

                        3.0.17 (umiyameboshi) 2015/02/05

* Version 3.0.17

    This is a bugfix release against pgpool-II 3.0.16.

    __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

    - doc: Describe explicitly that the number of slave nodes is not
      necessarily 1 (Tatsuo Ishii)

    - Fix uninitialized variable (Tatsuo Ishii)
      
      Per Coverity 1234603.

    - doc: Fix missing release note entries in the previous release
      (Tatsuo Ishii)

    - Fix node id range check bug in trigger_failover_command(). (Tatsuo Ishii)
      
      The node id should be lower than NUM_BACKENDS. Probably harmless since
      callers never pass node ids greater or equal to NUM_BACKENDS.

    - Fix to disable debug mode by reloading config (Yugo Nagata)
      
      Per bug #114
      http://www.pgpool.net/mantisbt/view.php?id=114

===============================================================================

                        3.0.16 (umiyameboshi) 2014/09/05

* Version 3.0.16

    This is a bugfix release against pgpool-II 3.0.15.

    __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

    - Fix a typo of pgpool.spec (Yugo Nagata)

    - Fix bug that worker child process keeps failing when there's no
      primary backend (Tatsuo Ishii)
      
      Problem identified and fix contributed by Junegunn Choi.
      
      See [pgpool-hackers: 471] for more details.

    - Close listen socket when smart shutdown request is made (Tatsuo Ishii)
      
      When smart shutdown process starts, pgpool children still listen on
      the port and clients can send further connection requests which fail
      in the end. Which is not only waste of time, but also prevents a load
      balancer which sits in front of pgpool from realizing the pgpool is
      going down.
      
      Problem analyzed and patch provided by Junegunn Choi in [pgpool-hackers
      474], and enhanced to take care not only inet domain socket but UNIX
      domain socket by Tatsuo Ishii.

    - doc: Add cautions that recovery commands are killed by statement_timeout
      of PostgreSQL. (Tatsuo Ishii)

    - doc: Remove old restriction description which is no longer true
      (Tatsuo Ishii)

    - Fix return type of text_to_lsn() function (Yugo Nagata)
      
      This caused compile warning.

    - Fix file descriptor leak when daemonize. (Tatsuo Ishii)
      
      Per Coverity 1111471.

    - Fix memory leak. (Tatsuo Ishii)
      
      Per Coverity 1111442.

    - Fix pgpool.init's long-standing bug of stop/restart failure
      (Yugo Nagata)
      
      In previous, pgpool.init uses killproc for stopping pgpool, but there
      are several problems. In the new version, "pgpool -m fast stop" is
      used in stop command.
      
      Original patch contributed by Ryan DeShone and modified by Yugo Nagata.
      
      See [pgpool-hackers: 239][pgpool-hackers: 512].

    - Disbale statement_timeout of PostgreSQL while executing online recovery
      (Tatsuo Ishii)
      
      Online recovery may take very long time and user may enable statement
      timeout. To prevent online recovery canceled by statement timeout,
      disable statement timeout in the connection used by online recovery.
      
      See [pgpool-general: 2919] for more details.

    - Remove unnecessary call to pool_shmem_exit() which removes semaphore
      when it shouldn't (Tatsuo Ishii)
      
      exit_handler checks if the process is parent or not. This is
      good. However, even if it is a child process, it calls
      pool_shmem_exit() which removes semaphore and shmem when it should
      not. It should be called only from parent process.
      
      Per bug #102.
      http://www.pgpool.net/mantisbt/view.php?id=102

    - Fix reset query stuck problem. (Tatsuo Ishii)
      
      It is reported that reset query (DISCARD ALL etc.) occasionally does
      not finish and pgpool child remain waiting for reply from backend thus
      client cannot connect to pgpool.
      
      The cause of problem is not identified yet but if client suddenly
      closes connection to pgpool in the middle of query processing, backend
      may not accept the reset queries because they are not ready for query.
      
      The fix is, if frontend closes connection in unexpected way, query
      process loop immediately returns with new state:
      POOL_END_WITH_FRONTEND_ERROR and pgpool closes connection to
      PostgreSQL then goes back to new connection request waiting loop.
      
      Also, pgpool closes connections to backend when client_idle_limit is
      set and the idle limit.
      
      Per bug #107.
      http://www.pgpool.net/mantisbt/view.php?id=107

                        3.0.15 (umiyameboshi) 2014/03/24

* Version 3.0.15

    This is a bugfix release against pgpool-II 3.0.14.

    __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

    - doc: Add mention about "listen queue" and how to increase the "backlog"
      in the num_init_children section. (Tatsuo Ishii)

    - Fix bad performance of unlogged tables detection code. (Tatsuo Ishii)

      Pointed out at [pgpool-hackers: 435][[pgpool-general:2325].

    - Fix primary node detection logic. (Tatsuo Ishii)

      There's a possibility that primary node is not detected. This happens
      in following situation.  node 0: primary, node 1: standby. Node 0 goes
      down. Health checking detects the fact but local status is not updated
      yet. Primary node finding (find_primary_node) runs. Node 0's status is
      yet healthy. Because find_primary_node fails to connect to node 0, it
      immediately returns -1 and fails to find that fact that node 1 is now
      primary.

      Fix is just continuing to look for primary node when fails to connect
      to a node.

      Per [pgpool-general: 2409].

    - Fix jdbc DML fails when operated in raw mode and auto commit is off.
      (Tatsuo Ishii)

      This is reported in bug #92.

    - Avoid to send queries to unrelated nodes in streaming replication mode.
      (Tatsuo Ishii)

      Pgpool-II sends certain queries, such as BEGIN, END and SET commands to
      all of DB nodes. However in streaming replication mode, only primary
      node and at most one standby node are only concerned (if primacy node
      is selected as the load balance node, only 1 node is concerned).

      See [pgpool-hackers: 464] for more details.

    - Fix possible buffer overrun problem and memory leak. (Tatsuo Ishii)

      Per Coverity 1111465 and 1111482.

    - Fix freeing NULL. (Tatsuo Ishii)

      Per Coverity 1111384.

    - Fix memory leak. (Tatsuo Ishii)

      Per Coverity 1111446.

    - Fix a segmentation fault in parallel mode with system_db_hostname is
      empty (Yugo Nagata)

    - Fix to output debug messages in processing pgpool.conf with -d option
      (Yugo Nagata)

      Previously, some debug messages in pool_get_config() ware not output
      even when -d option was used.

    - Fix JDBC exception of prepared statement including now() in
      replication mode (Yugo Nagata)

      With JDBC, when a prepared statement is executed more than
      PrepareThreshold times, the statement is named and Describe message
      is sent after Parse. With named statement, pgpool rewrite now() to
      parameter in replication mode. Hence, rewritten query has additonal
      parameter than original. In this case, ParameterDescription message
      sent to frontend (response of Describe) should include OIDs of the
      same number os original query's parameters. Otherwize, JDBC throws
      ArrayIndexoutOfBoundsException.

      This is reported in [pgpool-general-jp: 1192].

    - Fix backend error of prepared statement about table which has column whoes
      default value is now() in replication mode (Yugo Nagata)

      When pgpool parses a named prepared statement with default now(),
      timestamps are replaced to additional parameters. So, Bind message also
      should inclued additional parameter format codes. However, when the
      number of original parameter was one, pgpool didn't handle this. This
      caused a error like "incorrect binary data format in bind parameter 2".

    - doc: Add description about parallel mode doesn't support PREPARE (Yugo Nagata)

      Per bug #93

===============================================================================

                        3.0.14 (umiyameboshi) 2013/12/06

* Version 3.0.14

      This is a bugfix release against pgpool-II 3.0.13.

    __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

    - Fix incorrect time stamp rewriting in replication mode for certain time
      zones. (Tatsuo Ishii)

      Time stamp rewriting calls "SELECT now()" to get current time.
      Unfortunately the buffer for the current time is too small for certain
      time zones such as "02:30". Note that non-30-minutes-time-zone such as
      "0900" does not reveal the problem. This explains why we haven't the bug
      report until today.

      Bug reported in [pgpool-general: 2113] and fix provided by Sean Hogan.
      http://www.sraoss.jp/pipermail/pgpool-general/2013-September/002142.html

    - Makefile: Replace pg_config by $(PG_CONFIG) in Makefiles so it can be
      overridden at build time when compiling for different PG major versions.
      (Tatsuo Ishii)

      Patch contributed by Christoph Berg ([pgpool-general: 2127]).
      http://www.sraoss.jp/pipermail/pgpool-general/2013-September/002156.html

    - configure: Remove -lcompat because it confuses FreeBSD per bug#15.
      (Tatsuo Ishii)
      http://www.pgpool.net/mantisbt/view.php?id=15

    - Fix segfault when pgpool.conf does not set log_standby_delay.
      (Tatsuo Ishii)

      This is caused by wrong initialization for log_standby_delay in
      pool_config.l.
      Per bug#74. http://www.pgpool.net/mantisbt/view.php?id=74

    - doc: Modify descriptions about restrictions of parallel mode
      Muliple rows INSERT using VALUES are not supported in parallel mode.
      (Yugo Nagata)

    - Avoid calling find_primary_node_repeatedly() when standby node goes
      down. (Tatsuo Ishii)

      This will reduce the time to failover. Per bug #75, patch modified by
      Tatsuo Ishii. http://www.pgpool.net/mantisbt/view.php?id=75

    - Fix error message in read_password_packet(). (Tatsuo Ishii)

    - Fix memory leak when do_query() fails in timestamp rewriting.
      (Tatsuo Ishii)

      For this purpose free_select_result() is changed to accept NULL argument.
      Per Coverity report "1111454, 1111455 Resource leak".

    - Fix target node selection logic when "DEALLOCATE portal|statement".
      (Tatsuo Ishii)

      When "DEALLOCATE portal|statement" is used and last prepared statement or
      portal was not found, target node selection map is not set. Probably this
      is not actually harmful because prepared statement or portal was not found
      is an error case. The bug was there since day 0.

      Per Coverity report "1111491 Structurally dead code".

    - Fix range check bug of MAX_NUM_BACKENDS in corner case. (Tatsuo Ishii)

      MAX_NUM_BACKENDS is the allowed max number of DB nodes (128, at this
      point). In reality, probably no one ever tried more than 128 DB nodes
      and that's the reason why nobody noticed.

      Per Coverity report "1111429, 1111430 and 1111431 Out-of-bounds write".

    - Fix that the script forgets to allow public access to pgpool_catalog.
      (Tatsuo Ishii)

      The bug prevents inserting data into user tables if pgpool_catalog is
      created in native replication mode.  The bug was there from day 1. I
      wonder why nobody noticed until today.
      Per [pgpool-general-jp: 1229].
      http://www.sraoss.jp/pipermail/pgpool-general-jp/2013-November/001228.html

    - Fix uninitialized variable in error case in pool_do_auth().
      (Tatsuo Ishii)

      If there's no valid backend, pgpool will return garbage pid to frontend in
      auth phase. Actually because no backend is available, frontend will be
      disconnected later on. So this is not harmless.
      Per Coverity report "1127331 Uninitialized scalar variable".

    - Fix to add node id range check when issue an error message using node
      id. (Tatsuo Ishii)
      Per Coverity report #1111433 "Out-of-bounds read".

    - Fix buffer overrun bug and resource leak bug of parse_copy_data().
      (Tatsuo Ishii)
      Per Coverity report 1111427 "Out-of-bounds write" and 1111453 "Resource
      leak".

    - Fix possible segfault in CopyDataRaws(). (Tatsuo Ishii)
      Coverity pointed out that if pool_get_id() returns an error, VALID_BACKEND
      will access out of array.
      Per Coverity report 1111413 "Memory - illegal accesses".

    - Fix strftime() usage in pool_pools(). (Tatsuo Ishii)

      The buffer is not large enough as expected by the second parameter. This
      is not harmless because the format string will not produce longer result
      string than the buffer.
      Per Coverity report 1111426 "Out-of-bounds access".

    - Fix resource leak in make_persistent_db_connection. (Tatsio Ishii)

      For this pupose, new static function free_persisten_db_connection_memory
      is added.
      Per Coverity report #1111468.

===============================================================================

                        3.0.13 (umiyameboshi) 2013/09/06

* Version 3.0.13

      This is a bugfix release against pgpool-II 3.0.12.

    __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

    - Fix a mistake in ssh command of doc/basebackup.sh (Tatsuo Ishii)

    - Fix a bug in parsing prepared statements with transaction handling in
      replication mode (Tatsuo Ishii)

      Parse() automatically starts a transaction for non SELECT query to keep
      consistency among nodes in replication mode. But this wasn't closed. If
      wrong query comes in, the transaction goes into an abort state but pgpool
      does not close the transaction. Thus next query causes error because the
      transaction is still in abort status.

      This problem was reported in [pgpool-general: 1877] by Sean Hogan.

      [pgpool-general: 1877] current transaction is aborted, commands ignored
      http://www.sraoss.jp/pipermail/pgpool-general/2013-July/001905.html

    - Fix typos of the japanese document (Yugo Nagata)

===============================================================================

                        3.0.12 (umiyameboshi) 2013/07/10

* Version 3.0.12

      This is a bugfix release against pgpool-II 3.0.11.

    __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

    - Add mention about "-D" option to the man page. (Tatsuo Ishii)

    - Consider timeout waiting for compeletion of failback request in on line
      recovery (Tatsuo Ishii)

      This will prevent the situation that recovery operation continues forever
      and we cannot even shutdown pgpool-II main process. This could happen
      especially while executing follow master command.

    - Fix do_query() to not hang when PostgreSQL returns an error
      (Tatsuo Ishii)

      The typical symptom is "I see SELECT is keep on running according to
      pg_stat_activity". To fix this pgpool-II just exits the process and
      kill the existig connection.  This is not gentle but at this point I
      believe this is the best solution.

    - Fix bug with do_query which causes hung in extended protocol
      (Tatsuo Ishii)

      This problem could occur when insert lock is enabled and
      pgpool_catalog.insert_lock exists, See [pgpool-general: 1684] for more
      details.

      [pgpool-general: 1684] insert_lock hangs
      http://www.sraoss.jp/pipermail/pgpool-general/2013-May/001711.html

    - Fix unnecessary degeneration caused by error on commit (Tatsuo Ishii)

      In master slave mode, if master gets an error at commit, while other
      slaves are normal at commit, we don't need to degenrate any backend
      because it is likely that the "kind mismatch error" was caused by a
      deferred trigger.

    - Fix to register pgpool_regclass in pg_catalog schema (Tatsuo Ishii)

      This is necessary to deal with clients which restricts schema search path
      to pg_catalog only. Postgres_fdw is such a client.

    - Fix a potential crash in pg_md5 command (Muhammad Usama)

    - Fix a segmentation fault of a child process that occurs when a startup
      packet has no PostgreSQL user information (Yugo Nagata)

      You can reproduce it by

          $ psql -p 9999 -U ''

      If enable_pool_hba is on, a child process terminates by segmentation
      fault. Otherwise if enable_pool_hba is off, the error message is

          ERROR: pool_discard_cp: cannot get connection pool for user (null)
                 database (null)

      In both cases, psql terminates with no message on frontend.

      In the fixed version, if PostgreSQL user is not specified in startup packet,
      the message as following is output to both log and frontend. This is
      the same behavior as PostgreSQL.

          FATAL: no PostgreSQL user name specified in startup packet

    - Move ssl_ca_cert and ssl_ca_cert_dir descriptions to the SSL section
      (Yugo Nagata)

    - Add ssl_ca_cert and ssl_ca_cert_dir descriptions to the japanese document
      (Yugo Nagata)

    - Fix to verify the backend node number in pcp_recovery_node (Yugo Nagata)

      When an invalid number is used, null value is passed as an arguments
      of recovery script, and this causes a malfunction. In especially,
      rsync may delete unrelated files in basebackup scripts.

* Version 3.0.11

      This is a bugfix release against pgpool-II 3.0.10.

    __________________________________________________________________

* Buf fixes

    - Fix to show pool_passwd in "SHOW pool_status". (Yugo Nagata)

    - Fix long standing bug with timestamp rewriting code for processing
      extended protocol. (Tatsuo Ishii)

      Parse() allocate memory using palloc() while rewriting the parse
      message.  Problem is, the rewritten message was kept in the data which
      is managed by pool_create_sent_message() etc. The function assumes
      that all the data is in session context memory. However, palloc()
      allocates memory in query context of course, and gets freeed later on
      when the query context disappears. And the function tries to free the
      memory as well, which causes various problems, including segfault and
      double free. To fix this, memory to store rewritten message is
      allocated using session context. The bug was there since pgpool-II 3.0
      was born.

      Problem analysis and patch contributed by Naoya Anzai.

    - Fix to calculate replication delay only if standby server is behind from
      the primay server. (Yugo Nagata)

      When the primary server is behind from standby server, negative value of
      delay is calculated and the value is assigned to unsigned variable. It
      causes a log message informing negative replication delay. And what is
      worse, it also causes SELECT queries to be sent to the primary in load
      balance even though there are no replication delay in fact.

      The problem is reported and analyzed by Saitoh Hidenori in
      [pgpool-genera-jp: 1145].

    - Fix pool_has_pgpool_regclass() to check execute privilege of
      pgpool_regclass(). (Tatsuo Ishii)

      Even though pgpool_regclass() exists, if pgpool cannot execute the
      function, the connection to backend hangs. You can reproduce the problem
      by just dropping  the execute privilege from pgpool_regclass and do some
      insert in native replication mode.

      The problem is reported in bugtrack #53.

    - Fix error message mistakes in detect_postmaster_down_error(). (Tatsuo Ishii)

      For example, "LOG: detect_stop_postmaster_error: detect_error error" is
      fixed to "LOG: detect_postmaster_down_error: detect_error error", and so on.

    - Fix race condition when using md5 authentication. (Tatsuo Ishii)

      The file descriptor to pool_passwd is opened in pgpool main and pgpool
      child inherits it. When concurrent connections try to authenticate md5
      method, they call pool_get_passwd and seek the fd and cause random md5
      auth failure because underlying fd is shared. Fix is, let individual
      pgpool child open the file by calling pool_reopen_passwd_file.

      Problem reported and analyzed by Jason Slagle in pgpool-general:1141.

    - Fix pool_send_severity_message() not to use uninitialized memory.
      (Tatsuo Ishii)

      It cause a segmentaion fault.
      Reported in Bug #33's attached valgrind output by dudee.

    - Fix reaper() not to exit wait3() loop when catches pcp or worker child
      exit event. (Tatsuo Ishii)

      Otherwise reaper() mistakenly ignore some process exit event and make a
      risk of creating zombie process and forgetting to create new process.

      Problem reported and fix suggested by Goto in [pgpool-general-jp: 1123].
      http://www.sraoss.jp/pipermail/pgpool-general-jp/2012-November/001122.html
      (in Japanese)

    - Fix pool_search_relcache() to use MASTER or MASTER_NODE_ID macro, rather
      than REAL_MASTER_NODE_ID. (Tatsuo Ishii)

      In case node 0 fail back in streaming replication mode, pgpool does not
      restart child process.  So REAL_MASTER_NODE_ID looks for node 0 con info,
      which is not present until new connection to backend made. Thus referring
      to node con info results in segfault. MASTER or MASTER_NODE_ID are safe in
      this situation because they look at cached former master node id.

    - Fix long standing bug "portal not found" error when replication delay
      is too much in streaming replication mode. (Tatsuo Ishii)

      The bug had been there since the delay threshold was introduced.

      We changed destination DB node if delay threshold exceeds in bind,
      describe and execute. However, if parse sends to different node, bind,
      describe or execute will fail because no parsed statement or portal
      exists.  Solution is, not to send to different parse node even
      if delay threshold is too much.

    - Fix pg_md5 to output "\n" after user inputs password. (Yugo Nagata)

    - Fix child_exit() to not call send_frontend_exits() if there's no
      connection pool. (Tatsuo Ishii)

      Otherwise, it segfaults because send_frontend_exits() referes to objects
      pointed to by pool_connection_pool. Per bug track #44 by tuomas.

    - Fix read_startup_packet() to reset alarm and free StartupPacket when
      pool_read() returns 0 which means incorrect packet length. (Nozomi Anzai)

      Previously, authentication timeout occurs when connected by a program
      monitoring the pgpool port.It is reported in bug track #35 by tuomas.

    - Fix long standing bug with pool_open(). (Tatsuo Ishii)

      It initializes wrong buffer pointer. Actually this is harmless because the
      pointer is initialized by prior memset() call, though.

    - Add a description about "-f" to help message. (Tatsuo Ishii)

    - Modify documents to correct information of whether a certain parameter
      change requires restart. (Yugo Nagata)

    - Add pool_passwd option to pgpool.conf.sample*, and documents. (Yugo Nagata)

* Version 3.0.9

      This is a bugfix release against pgpool-II 3.0.8.

    __________________________________________________________________

* General

    - Fix read_startup_packet. (Tatsuo Ishii)

      If packet length is lower than 0, it should
      have returned immediately. Otherwise it would cause memory allocation
      error later on.  per pgpool-general:886.
      Also add canceling alarm.

    - Add NOTICE message handling to s_do_auth. (Tatsuo Ishii)

      Without this, health check responses false alarm and causes failover.
      per bug track:
      http://www.pgpool.net/mantisbt/view.php?id=25
      Also allow to receive ready for query packet *not* right after backend
      keydata.  I'm not sure if this could happen in the real world but the
      protocol seems to allow this.

    - Remove unnecessary/confusing debug log from s_do_auth.(Tatsuo Ishii)

    - Fix inifinit loop in SSL mode. When there's pending data in SSL layer
      of frontend, pool_process_query() checks pending data in backend.
      (Tatsuo Ishii)

      If there's non, it loops again and checks frontend/backend receive buffer
      by using is_cache_empty(). Unfortunately it first checks pending data
      in SSL layer of frontend, thus goes to backend data and checks again
      (infinite loop).
      The solution is, if there's pending data in SSL layer of frontend and
      query is not in progress, call ProcessFrontendResponse() to process new
      request from frontend.

    - Fix is_system_catalog to use pgpool_regclass if available.
      (Tatsuo Ishii)

    - Fix memory leak in pool_get_insert_table_name(). (Tatsuo Ishii)

      If session context's memory contex is used for nodeToString(), memory is
      not freed until session ends.

    - Fix possible memory leak in nodeToString(). (Tatsuo Ishii)

      Since the memory context could be session context, memory used for
      String object may be considerable if user session continues for hours or
      days.
      See bug track #24 for more details.

    - Fix long standing problem with do_query(). (Tatsuo Ishii)

      When 1) extended protocol used and 2)unnamed portal is used and 3) no
      explicit transaction is used, user's unnamed portal is removed by Sync
      message.
      This is because Sync message closes transaction and unnamed portal is
      removed. This leads to "portal "" does not exist" error.

      Fix is, use "Flush" message instead of Sync. Main difference between
      using Sync and Flush is, Flush does not return Ready for Query message.
      So do_query() does not return until all expected responses are returned.
      It seems the order of messages returned from backend is random, and
      do_query () manages it by using state bits.

* Bug fixes

      - Fix load balance in Solaris. (Tatsuo Ishii)

        Problem is, random() in using random() in Solaris results in strange
        load balancing calculation.
        Use srand()/rand() instead although they produce lesser quality random
        Problem reported at [pgpool-general: 396].

          http://www.pgpool.net/pipermail/pgpool-general/2012-April/000397.html

      - Fix segfault of pcp_systemdb_info not in parallel mode. (Nozomi Anzai)

      - Fix "unnamed prepared statment does not exist" error. (Tatsuo Ishii)

        This is caused by pgpool's internal query, which breaks client's
        unnamed statements. To fix this, if extended query is used, named
        statement/portal for internal are used for internal query.

      - Fix is_system_catalog(). Its relcach was accidently defined as
        "session local". (Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Improve reading and writing pid_file. (Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix pool_process_query() bug reported in [pgpool-general: 672].
        (Tatsuo Ishii)

        This is caused by the function waits for primary node which does not
        have pending data, while standbys have pending data.

      - Fix wait_for_query_response() not to send param status to frontend if
        frontend is NULL. (Tatsuo Ishii)

        This could happen while processing reset_query_list and occur crash.

      __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

      - Fix infinite loop reported in this thread (Tatsuo Ishii):
        http://www.pgpool.net/pipermail/pgpool-general/2011-December/000099.html

        It was not considered the case that, when received buffer in primary was
        empty but the one in a standby was not, the standby spontaneously sent
        packet to pgpool.
        This could happen when, for example, reloading postgresql.conf.
        The fix is that such buffer in standby is discarded.

===============================================================================

                        3.0.5 (umiyameboshi) 2011/10/31

* Version 3.0.5

      This version fixes various bugs since 3.0.4.

      __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

      - Fix bug with the handling of empty queries. The empty queries
        come to be handled the same as SELECT queries. This fix allows
        load-balance after the empty query(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Fix insert_lock so that it works correctly even if the column
        definition such as "DEFAULT nextval(('"x_seq"'::text)::regclass)"
        (Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Fix log message which is emitted when pgpool-II cannot parse the
        query in the extended query protocol so that it shows the query
        (Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Fix description about backend_weight inpgpool-II manual. It can
        be changed by reloading pgpool.conf(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix bug which does not update the node status when reattaching the
        node in raw mode(Guillaume Lelarge)

      - Fix bug that SELECTs which have subquery with FOR SHARE/UPDATE clause
        are sent to slave/standby(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix bug which rewriting timestamp of default value fails in PREPARE
        statements. This used to work but was broken in 3.0(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Fix crash of pgpool child when frontend connects if in raw mode,
        enable_hba is off and more than 2 backends(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Fix some memory leaks(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      __________________________________________________________________

* Enhancements

      - Allow time stamp rewriting to work with arbitrary expression in
        default value of a column. Before we detected anything including
        now() then simply replaced it to now(). This will lead to wrong
        rewriting of default value. for example, timezone('utc'::text, now()).
        Note that, however, this only adopts to simple queries. Extended
        protocols(for example Java, PHP PDO) or SQL "PREPARE" still remain
        same(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Change error message "do_md5: read_password_packet failed" into debug
        level(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

===============================================================================

                        3.0.4 (umiyameboshi) 2011/06/01

* Version 3.0.4

      This version fixes various bugs since 3.0.3.

      __________________________________________________________________

* Incompatible changes

      - In streaming replication, if delay_threshold is 0 or health
        checking is disabled, the delay checking is not performed.
        This is the behaviour according to a description of the
        pgpool-II manual. But, so far the delay checking was performed
        even if health checking was disabled(Guillaume Lelarge)

      __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

      - Fix pgpool-regclass() to be compiled in PostgreSQL 8.0 or later.
        7.4 still produces errors(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix possible hangup when using /*NO LOAD BALANCE*/ comment in
        streaming replication(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Fix hangup when received Flush(H) message or CloseComplete(C)
        message(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Fix possible hangup that happen for the receiving timing of
        ReadyForQuery(Z) message after pgpool-II connects to backends(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Add description about parameters for recovery_1st_stage_command
        and recovery_2nd_stage_command(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Increase size of the internal system catalog cache from 32 to 128.
        This has the effect of reducing "unnamed prepared statement does
        not exist" error(Tatsuo, Kitagawa)

      - Fix bug with pcp_connect() which causes double free. Patch
        contributed by Jehan-Guillaume (ioguix) de Rorthais(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix bug with start_recoery() which is apparently wrong usage of
        PQfinish()(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix incorrect error message which is sent to the frontend when
        client idle time reached client_idle_limit(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix "backend status" variable name correctly in pool_status.
        Replace the space with a '_'(Guillaume Lelarge)

      - Fix hangup when using md5 authentication method and running as
        daemon. Patch contributed by Nicolas Thauvin(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix log_per_node_statement so that it prints statements in the
        extended query protocol. This used to work but was broken in 3.0
        (Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      __________________________________________________________________

* Enhancements

      - Add currval() and lastval() to black_function_list of sample
        configuration files. If they are load balanced, currval() or
        lastval() may be called before the result of nextval() or setval()
        is propagated to slaves(Tatsuo Ishii)

                        3.0.3 (umiyameboshi) 2011/02/23

* Version 3.0.3

      This version fixes various bugs since 3.0.1. Please note that
      3.0.2 was canceled due to a packaging problem.

      __________________________________________________________________

* Incompatible changes

      - Now installing C function "pgpool_walrecrunning()" is recommended
          if you plan to use streaming replication mode.
          This is necessary for better use of online recovery in the mode.
        Also new variable "%P" can be used in the online recovery script.
        If you do not install the function, these functionalities cannot be
        used(Tatsuo Ishii).

      - In raw mode if there's only one DB node and if a problem arises
        with the DB node, it will be brought to down status. However if
        the DB node goes into good condition again, you can use the DB
        node without restarting pgpool. This change has been included in
        3.0, but did not work(Tatsuo, Kitagawa)

      __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

      - Fix non portable code in password authentication.
        Bug report from a FreeBSD user(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix bug that insert_lock locks all rows in user table
        (Tatsuo, Kitagawa)

      - Fix bug with password authentication. If user name is 32 bytes
        long, pgpool child segfaults.(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix bug with md5 authentication. If raw mode or number of
        backend is 1, pgpool child segfaults. Patch contributed by

      - Fix possible crash of pgpool child while doing failover(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Fix white/black_function_list so that it works correctly when user
        calls function with schema name(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix bug that DROP DATABASE fails by connection cache(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Fix bug that failover fails in raw mode(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Fix possible termination of pgpool child when both simple query
        protocol and extended query protocol are used in one session
        (Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Fix possible hang up when an error occurs while using extended
        query protocol(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Fix pgpool-regclass() so that it doesn't use PG_TRY/CATCH.
        It appeared that using PG_TRY/CATCH is not safe, sometimes backend
        dies with PANIC:  ERRORDATA_STACK_SIZE exceeded.(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix bug that select query isn't sent to master node when it meets
        the following conditions(Toshihiro Kitagawa)
        - in MASTER/SLAVE mode
        - use extended query protocol
        - started transaction explicitly
        - after write queries

      - Fix bug with load_balance that JDBC driver sends BEGIN to master node
        many times(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Fix pool_status so that failback_command and fail_over_on_backend_error
        show correct values(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Remove parameters from pool_status: recovery_password,
        system_db_password(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Fix online recovery problem in the streaming replication
        mode(Tatsuo Ishii). Consider following scenario. Suppose node 0 is
        the initial primary server and 1 is the initial standby
        server.

        1) Node 0 going down and node 1 promotes to new primary.
        2) Recover node 0 as new standby.
        3) pgpool-II assumes that node 0 is the new primary.

        This problem happens because pgpool-II regarded unconditionally
        the youngest node to be the primary. pgpool-II 3.0.3 now checks
        each node by using pgpool_walrecrunning() to see if it is a
        actually primary or not and is able to avoid the problem and
        regards node as standby correctly. Also you can use new
        variable "%P" to be used in the recovery script.  If you do
        not install the function, the above problem is not resolved.

      - Fix backend complaining "unexpected EOF on client connection"
        while doing failover in streaming replication mode(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix pgpool crashes when all backends go down(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix replication delay checking so that it does not keep persistent
        connection to backends. Because the persistent connection may
        become bogus if a node down and then wake up between replication
        delay checking period(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Rewrite and review english document(Marc Cousin, Gleu)

===============================================================================

                        3.0 (umiyameboshi) 2010/09/10

* Version 3.0

      This is the first version of pgpool-II 3.0 series.
      That is, a "major version up" from 2.2 or 2.3 series.

      The biggest news is, this version adapts to PostgreSQL 9.0's new
      feature: Streaming Replication/Hot Standby. Streaming
      replication can be used as a sub mode of master slave
      mode. Master slave mode itself heavily enhanced:

      - SELECTs in explicit transactions can be load balanced

      - In extended protocol, PARSE/BIND/DESCRIBE messages are sent to
        the node which execute EXECUTE message, not all node. This
        will reduce lock contentions.

      - Auto start of transaction happens only when it needed.

      - Temporary tables can be used safely.

      - SELECT which calls functions possibly write to database
        executes on master(primary)

      Also many new features are added and major refactoring has been
      made to the internal structure of pgpoo-II. For example, in
      replication mode, SELECTs calling functions possibly write to
      database will not allow to load balance.

      __________________________________________________________________

* New features

      - Online recovery can be used with master/slave/streaming
        replication mode(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - New directive "delay_threshold" is added to monitor
        replication delay in master/slave/streaming replication
        mode. If replication delay is too much, SELECTs are not load
        balanced(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - show pool_status shows replication delay in
        master/slave/streaming replication mode(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - New directive "log_standby_delay" is added to control logging of
        replication delay in master/slave/streaming replication
        mode(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - When insert_lock is enabled and the table includes SERIAL data
        type, issue row lock on the sequence table. Before we issues
        table lock. Problem is, the table lock conflicts with auto
        vacuum and sometimes caused excessive lock waiting(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Add support for more "SHOW" commands: pool_nodes,
        pool_processes, pool_pools, and pool_version(Guillaume Lelarge)

      - Backend process id and whether frontend connects to this
        connection pool or not are added to pcp_proc_info's
        output(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - "Gracefuly detach" option is added to pcp_detatch_node. With
        this option, pcp_detatch_node waits until all frontends
        disconnected(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - New directive "white_function_list" and "black_function_list"
        are added to register functions those do not or do write to
        database(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - In master/slave mode, SELECTs to system catalogs executes only
        on master/primary(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - In master/slave mode, SELECTs to temporary table executes only
        on master/primary(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - In master/slave mode, write queries outside of explicit
        transactions no longer trigger to start internal
        transaction(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - In master/slave mode, SELECTs inside explicit transactions are
        load balanced(Tatsuo, Kitagawa)

      - In master/slave mode, commands are no longer sent to all DB
        nodes. This will prevent unnecessary locking(Tatsuo, Kitagawa)

      - New command option adds to ignore the status file when
        starting up(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Supports PostgreSQL 9.0's new VACUUM syntax(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - New directive "failover_if_affected_tuples_mismatch" controls
        the behavior when number of result rows of
        INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE are differ(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - When number of result rows of INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE are
        differ, each number are logged(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - md5 authentication is supported in replication mode and
        master/slave mode(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Allow to force to move to online recovery second stage even
        there are connecting frontends(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - If there's only one DB node and it triggers failover,
        pgpool-II will automatically connects if the DB node coming
        up(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Pcp commands supports long options(Guillaume Lelarge)

      - New directive "debug_level" added to control the debug message
        logging(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Allow to use various boolean representations as PostgreSQL in
        pgpool.conf(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - New C language function pgpool_switch_xlog for online recovery
        added(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - New C language function pgpool_regclass added to avoid a trouble
        about handling of duplicate table names in different schema(Tatsuo Ishii)

      __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

      - Do not rewrite statement which accesses columns having now()
        etc. as the default value but the data type are not timestamp
        etc.  Otherwise we have an error in DMLs(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix timestamp rewriting not to omit schema qualification(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix bug with timeout handling in pcp commands(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix SSL hang when large amount of data transfered(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix failover when there's only one DB node(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix bug with postmaster start check in online recovery.
        Before it continued infinitely to try to connect to postmaster
        if the first attempt failed(Tatsuo Ishii)

===============================================================================

                    2.3.4 (tomiteboshi) 2012/08/06

* Version 2.3.4

      This version fixes various bugs since 2.3.3.

      __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

    - Fix do_error_execute_command() so that it discards responses from
      backend until ErrorResponse received. (Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      Note that we need to preserve non-error responses (i.e. ReadyForQuery)
      and put back them using pool_unread().
      Otherwise, ReadyForQuery response of DEALLOCATE. This could happen if
      PHP PDO used.

    - Fix SimpleForwardToFrontend() so that it reset select_in_transaction
      flag and execute_select flag when bind error occurred while executing
      SELECT. (Toshihiro Kitagawa)

    - Fix SSL connection sometimes hung if lots of data read from backend.
      This is caused by the buffering in OpenSSL layer. To fix the problem,
      (Tatsuo Ishii)

      we check the buffer has any pending data by using SSL_pending() before
      calling select(2).
      See thread [Pgpool-general] Fwd: PGPOOL II 2.3.3 hang in ssl mode for
      more details.

    - Fix bug with pcp_check_fd()'s timeout handling. (Tatsuo Ishii)

      Per erboles.
        Subject: [Pgpool-general] question about pcp_check_fd
        Date: Sun, 23 May 2010 18:21:41 -0500
        To: pgpool <pgpool-general@pgfoundry.org>

    - Do not force replication of DEALLOCATE if operated in master/slave mode.
      Reported by Jan Kantert. (Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      See:
        Subject: [Pgpool-hackers] Problems with PgPool 2.3.3 Prepare /

      For more details.

    - Make timestamp rewriting schema aware. (Tatsuo Ishii)

    - Do not rewrite statement which accesses columns having now() etc. as the
      default value but the data type are not timestamp etc. (Tatsuo Ishii)

      Otherwise we have an error in DMLS. See:
        Subject: [Pgpool-general] function epoch seems to be causing error

        Date: Mon, 16 Aug 2010 21:48:31 +0000 (UTC)
      For more details.

    - Fix insert_lock to be schema aware. (Tatsuo Ishii)

    - Fix long standing bug with timestamp rewriting against array and complex
      types.  (Tatsuo Ishii)


      Failed examples are:

        INSERT INTO r1(col[1], col2.foo) VALUES (1, 2); -- insert_column_item
        UPDATE r1 SET col1[1] = 1, col2.foo = 1; -- set_target
        PREPARE "p" (int4[]) AS  SELECT $1[1]; -- c_expr
        SELECT (ARRAY[1,2,3])[1];
        SELECT (ARRAY[ARRAY[1]])[1][1];
        SELECT ('{1,2,3}'::int[])[1];
        SELECT ('{1,2,3}'::int[3])[1];
        SELECT r1.col[1], (r1.col1).bar, (r1.col1).* FROM r1; -- columnref
        SELECT (r1.col1).baz[1], (r1.col1).baz[1][2] FROM r1;

      Patch provided by Akio Ishida.

    - Fix buffer overrun problem when pcp password is longer than 32.
      (Tatsuo Ishii)

    - Fix wait_for_query_response() not to send param status to frontend if
      frontend is NULL. This could happen while processing reset_query_list.
      (Tatsuo Ishii)

===============================================================================

                        2.3.3 (tomiteboshi) 2010/04/23

* Version 2.3.3

      This version fixes various bugs since 2.3.2.2.

      __________________________________________________________________

* Incompatible changes

      - Please note that this version of pgpool consumes more shared
        memory than before. If you encounter problems when starting up
        pgpool, please look into pgpool log. If you find messages
        something like "could not create shared memory segment: Cannot
        allocate memory", please increase the shared memory on your
        system.

      - Now parallel mode requires replication mode turned
        on. parallel mode without replication mode turned on has been
        broken since pgpool-II was born anyway(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Change default value for insert_lock to false since there's no
        point in turning this on in master/slave mode. Fix suggested by
        Fujii Masao(Tatsuo Ishii)

      __________________________________________________________________

* Newly added documents

      - README.online-recovery, which is an internal document of
        online recovery, added(Tatsuo Ishii)

      __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

      - Fix long standing bug since pgpool-II 1.0 which causes
        segfault of pgpool child process.  This was caused by
        miscalculation of shmem size in pgpool parent. Bug analysis by
        Kitagawa patch created by Tatsuo

      - Add restriction for parallel mode(Toshihiro Kitagawa)
        - The Natural Join is not supported
        - The USING CLAUSE is converted to ON CLAUSE by query rewrite
          process

      - Fix possible crash during rewriting JOIN syntax that have
        USING in parallel query mode(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

        This fix is supporting such as following JOIN syntax.

         example:
         - SELECT * FROM a JOIN b USING (aid) JOIN c USING (cid);
         - SELECT * FROM a JOIN b USING (aid) JOIN c USING (cid)
           JOIN d USING (did)

      - Fix parallel query so that it can parse INSERT statements that
        have current_time before a partitioning key column
        (Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Fix SimpleForwardToBackend() so that pgpool doesn't keep
        waiting for reply from a backend, when clients using the
        extended query protocol cause a command error such as bind
        error. This bug occur in master/slave, raw, and connection
        pool mode.  This fix is, sending SYNC message to recover error
        after command error(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Fix SIGINT/SIGQUIT is ignored if pgpool child is in
        select(). In this case pgpool retries select() thus the signal
        is ignored(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix connect_inet_domain_socket_by_port/
        connect_unix_domain_socket_by_port so that they check if
        SIGTERM/SIGINT/SIGQUIT signal has been delivered.  Per bug
        report from Daniel Codina(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix possible crash during creating "kind mismatch" error
        message. This used to work but was broken in 2.3.2(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix bug with healh checking. If a network problem such as
        unplugged wire happens while calling connect(), health
        checking does not work since
        connect_unix_domain_socket()/connect_inet_domain_socket() do
        retry if connect() is interrupted by ALARM signal. Added new
        retry argument which controls the retrying behavior to those
        functions.  Per bug report and problem analysis by Daniel
        Codina(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix enbug in 2.3.2.2 with time stamp rewriting in
        SimpleForwardToBackend. Per bug report from Bugtrack #1010771.
        Report from Peter Pramberge(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix rewriting "*" in paralell query.  Patch conributed by
        sho-san(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Fix connect_inet_domain_socket_by_port() so that it print out
        error message by using hstrerror(), rather than
        strerror()(Tatsuo Ishii)

===============================================================================

                    2.3.2.2 (tomiteboshi) 2010/02/22

* Version 2.3.2.2

      This version fixes various bug in 2.3.x.

      - When rewriting timestamp in extended query, it allocated less
        than what it actually needed. This causes random problematic
        behavior, typically "message: invalid string in message" error
        in backend(Tatsuo Ishii).

      - In extended query, if one of parameters contains NULL, ppool
        crashes(Tatsuo Ishii).

      - If in previous status file all nodes were marked down status,
        it is regarded that this file is bogus. This will prevent "all
        node down" syndrome(Tatsuo Ishii).

===============================================================================

                    2.3.2.1 (tomiteboshi) 2010/02/11

* Version 2.3.2.1

      This version fixes bug in 2.3.x. It is identfied that
      pgpool-II 2.3.x has a problem with erroneous query
      processing(Akio Ishida).

===============================================================================

                    2.3.2 (tomiteboshi) 2010/02/07

* Version 2.3.2

      This version includes various fixes for bugs in 2.3.1 or before.
      All 2.3.x users are encouraged to upgrade to 2.3.2 as soon as
      possible.

      Also this version enables long awaited SSL support and large
      object replication support.

      __________________________________________________________________

* Enhancements

      - SSL support(Sean Finney)

      - Large object replication support. You need PostgreSQL 8.1 or
        later, however(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Emit statement log when error or notice message comes from
        query parsing process. This is usefull because PostgreSQL does
        not log particular statement if the error was detected
        *before* raw parser get executed.  This typlically happens
        when encoding error was found(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Display original query to log if kind mismatch error was
        caused by DEALLOCATE(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - While health checking and recovery use postgres database if
        possible.  If postgres database does not exist, use template1
        as it stands now.  While connecting template1, certain
        commands, for example DROP DATABASE cannot used. Using postgres
        database allows to use these commands while recovery(Tatsuo Ishii)

      __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

      - Fix errors in timestamp rewriting which occasionaly cause
        broken packet sentto slave nodes(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix errors when timestamp rewriting is used with V2
        protocol(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Propagate Bind, Describe and Close messages to only master
        node if running in master/slave and in transaction (Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix do_child() so that check_stop_request() exits immediately
        when smart shutdown signal has been sent.  This has been used
        to work in 2.2(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Fix ProcessFrontendResponse not to accept invalid frotend
        packet(Xavier Noguer)

      - Use %dz for sizeof in fprintf for more portability(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix compiler warnings(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Do not force replication of DEALLOCATE if operated in
        master/slave mode. Now that pgpool do not execute PARSE in all
        nodes, this was pointless and caused problem (kind mismatch
        when executing DEALLOCATE)(Tatsuo Ishii)

===============================================================================

                        2.3.1 (tomiteboshi) 2009/12/18

* Version 2.3.1

      This version includes various fixes for bugs in 2.3 or before.
      All 2.3 users are encouraged to upgrade to 2.3.1 as soon as
      possible.
      __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

      - If all of following conditions met, incorrect data is written
        to DB(Tatsuo Ishii)

        - pgpool is running in replication mode
        - pgpool is running on 64bit OS
        - INSERT or UPDATE are used which explicitly include now(),
        - CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME. Or the target
        - Table's default value use above functions
        - The SQL statement inclludes out of 32bit
          integer value(-2147483648 to 2147483647 in decimal)

        Example SQL: INSERT INTO t1(id, regdate) VALUES(98887776655,
        NOW());

      - Fix crush in case of more than 18 DB nodes are used(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Enhance kind mismatch error message. If kind is ERROR or
        NOTICE, the error or notice message from PostgreSQL will be printed
        (Tatsuo Ishii)

===============================================================================

                            2.3 (tomiteboshi) 2009/12/07

* Version 2.3

      This version enhances replication, especially CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
      CURRENT_DATE, now() etc. now can be properly replicated. Also
      perforance of replication when num_init_children == 1 is
      enhanced. Pgpool-II now records the status of down nodes, and
      remember when it restarts to ensure that keep the node status as
      before. Also some logs are enhanced and more fine fail over
      controls are added. Please note that pgpool-II 2.3 includes all
      of enhancements and fixes of pgpool-II 2.2.1 to 2.2.6.

      __________________________________________________________________

* Incompatibilities from 2.2.x

      - pgpool_status file is created under logdir. So you need to
        give write permission to the directory so that pgpool-II can
        read/write pgpool_status file.

      __________________________________________________________________

* Enhancements

      - Enable proper replication of results of temporal functions
        (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_DATE, now() etc.). Now
        applications can execute INSERT/UPDATE tables which include
        defaut values using those temporal functions. There are small
        limitations. See restriction sections of docs for more
        details (Akio Ishida)

      - Use PostgreSQL 8.4's SQL parser(Akio Ishida)

      - Enhance the performance 20% to 100% of replication when
        num_init_children == 1(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Add new directive log_per_node_statement which is similar to
        log_statement except that prints info for each DB node to make
        it easier which query is sent to which DB node(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Add new directive fail_over_on_backend_error to control the
         behaviro of fail over(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Record DB node status and remember when pgpool-II restarts(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE for SELECT query are now load
        balanced. This will prevent unwanted kind mismatch errors when
        EXPLAIN produces slightly different plan(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Enhance CSS of pgpool-ja.html(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Add sample configuration file for replication mode and
        master/slave mode(Tatsuo Ishii)

     - Add test for temporal data(Akio Ishida)

      fixes for bugs in 2.2.5 or before as usual.

      __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

      - Do not allow to load balance DECLARE, CLOSE, FETCH and
        MOVE. If data gets updated and CLOSE issued after transaction
        commit(i.e. holdbale cursor), this will cause data
        inconsistency since CLOSE is executed one of the severs,
        rather than all(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - In master/slave mode, execute Parse message on only master
        node. In previous versions Parse executed on all nodes, which
        grabbed unneccessary lock(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Remove init script from all runlevels before uninstall(Devrim)

      - Fix pgpoo.spec(Devrim)

      - Do not execute REINDEX DATABASE or SYSTEM, CREATE/DROP TABLE
        SPACE inside a transaction block(Tatsuo Ishii)

      __________________________________________________________________

* Enhancements

      - Allow to change weight by reloading pgool.conf. This will take
        effect for next client sessions(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Reply with usefull error messages, rather than "server closed
        the connection unexpectedly" when authentication fails(Glyn
        Astill)

      - Add info to logs when writing to sockets falis to know if it
        was for backend or frontend(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Do not complain when writing to socket of frontend
        fails(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Allow to use temp tables in master/slave
        mode. INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE will automatically be sent to
        master only. Still SELECT you need to add /*NO LOAD BALANCE*/
        comment(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Add temp table test to test/jdbc(Tatsuo Ishii)

* Version 2.2.5

      This version fixes various bugs in 2.2.4 or before.

      __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

      - Fix connection_count_down(). It decrements the connection
        counter too much in some corner cases and causes online
        recover never completes(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Detect frontend exiting while waiting for commands complete in
        other cases such as internal locks are issued and Parse
        (Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix inifinit loop in reset_backend(Xavier Noguer, Tatsuo)

      - Fix Parse() to print actual query when it detects kind
        mismatch error(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Document enhancements(Tatsuo Ishii)

===============================================================================

                        2.2.4 (urukiboshi) 2009/8/24

* Version 2.2.4

      This version fixes various bugs in 2.2.3 or before.

      __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

      - Fix possible bug introduced in pgpool-II 2.2.2.  Load balance
        control variables may remain not be restored and subsequent
        DML/DDL call might sent to only master node(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Send NOTICE message to frontend periodically if V2 protocol is
        used. This is ifdef out since it affectes visible change to
        applications.  2.2.3 unconditionaly sends param packet to
        client even it uses version 2 protocol, which is apparentlt
        wrong. Also tweak checking period from 1 second to 30 seconds
        since 1 second seems too aggressive(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Block signals before forking children rather after.  Otherwise
        parent will be killed by failover signal if it receives a
        signal before establishing signal handler(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Remove unnecessary spaces and tabs at the end of line(Jun Kuriyama)

      This version fixes various bugs in 2.2.2 or before.

      __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

      - Fix child process death if one of backends is not available(Tatsuo Ishii).

      - Fix various parallel query bugs(Yoshiharu Mori)

      - Fix message corruption for kid mismatch error(Akio Ishida)

      - Now stetmemt_time works(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Enhance health checking to detect postmaster stopping by
        SIGSTOP(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Detect frontend abnormal exiting while waiting for reply from
        backend. This only works with V3 protocol(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Do not start internal transaction if command is CLUSTER
        without arguments(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix bug with COPY FROM in that backend process remains after

      __________________________________________________________________

* Enhancements

      - Show last query for extended protocol(Akio Ishida)

      - Allow to compile sql/pgpool-recovery/pgpool-recovery.c with
        PostgreSQL 8.4(Tatsuo Ishii)

===============================================================================

                        2.2.2 (urukiboshi) 2009/5/5

* Version 2.2.2

      This version fixes various bugs in 2.2.1 or before. Please note
      that an importan fix is made to avoid data incositency risk,
      which could happen when client does not exit gracely(without
      sending "X" packet) while pgpool is trying to send data to
      it. This could happen with all version of pgpool-II.

      __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

      - Ignore write error on frontend connection. This is needed to
        continue processing with backend, otherwise we risk data
        incositency(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Fix bug introduced in 2.2.1 (In master slave mode, sometimes
          DEALLOCATE fails). If prepared statement reused, pgpool
          hangs(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Fix pgpool crash when SQL command PREPARE and protocol level
        EXECUTE are mixed. The bug was introduced in 2.2(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Avoid "unexpected EOF on client connection" error in PostgreSQL
        when reset query fails(Tatsuo Ishii)

===============================================================================

                        2.2.1 (urukiboshi) 2009/4/25

* Version 2.2.1

      This version fixes various bugs in 2.2.

      __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

      - In master slave mode, sometimes DEALLOCATE fails. This is
        caused by that the first PREPARE was not executed on the
        slave(Toshihiro Kitagawa)

      - Update pgpool.spec along with related files(Devrim)

      - Fix inser_lock so that it is ignored when protocol version is
        2(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Remove excessive log messages regarding parameter change notice(Tatsuo Ishii)

      - Add missing files to doc(Tatsuo Ishii)

===============================================================================

                            2.2 (urukiboshi) 2009/2/28

* Version 2.2

      This version enhances SERIAL data type handling and on line
      recovery. Also an important bug, serializable transactions could
      cause data inconsistency among DB nodes, is fixed. Query
      cancelation, which never worked since pgpool-II was born, is
      finally fixed.

      __________________________________________________________________

* New features/enhancements

        - With insert_lock, now a table is locked only if it has
          SERIAL data type and now the default value for insert_lock
          is true(Tatsuo Ishii)

        - Start internal transaction other than INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
          and SELECT to keep node consistency(Tatsuo Ishii)

        - Add client_idle_limit_in_recovery directive. This will
          prevent 2nd stage of on line recovery from not going forward
          by idle clients sitting forever(Tatsuo Ishii)

        - Add pid_file_name directive which specifies a path to the
          file containing pgpool process id. "logdir" is no more used(Tatsuo Ishii)

        - Allow to load balance DECLARE, FETCH and CLOSE(Tatsuo Ishii)

        - Add -d option to pcp commands(Jun Kuriyama)

        - Enahnce kind mismatch error message to include originarl
          query string(Tatsuo Ishii)

      __________________________________________________________________

* Bug fixes

        - Close all file descriptors when running in daemon mode.
          Otherwise we inherit sockets from apache when it's
          started by pgpoolAdmin. This results in that port 80 is
          occupied for example.  Patch provided by Akio
          Ishida. Also add chdir("/"). This is always good for
          daemon programs(Tatsuo Ishii)

        - Allow MD5 authentication in raw mode as stated in docs(Tatsuo Ishii)

        - Check transaction serialization failure error in
          serializable mode and abort all nodes if so. Otherwise
          we allow data inconsistency among DB nodes(Tatsuo Ishii).

          See following scenario: (M:master, S:slave)

            M:S1:BEGIN;
            M:S2:BEGIN;
            S:S1:BEGIN;
            S:S2:BEGIN;
            M:S1:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
            M:S2:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
            S:S1:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
            S:S2:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
            M:S1:UPDATE t1 SET i = i + 1;
            S:S1:UPDATE t1 SET i = i + 1;
            M:S2:UPDATE t1 SET i = i + 1; <-- blocked
            S:S1:COMMIT;
            M:S1:COMMIT;
            M:S2:ERROR:  could not serialize access due to concurrent update
            S:S2:UPDATE t1 SET i = i + 1; <-- success in UPDATE and data
                                              becomes inconsistent!

        - avoid kind mismatch error caused by "SET TRANSACTION
          ISOLATION LEVEL must be called before any query"(Tatsuo Ishii).

           This could happen in following scenario:

            M:S1:BEGIN;
            S:S1:BEGIN;
            M:S1:SELECT 1; <-- only sent to MASTER
            M:S1:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
            S:S1:SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
            M: <-- error
            S: <-- ok since no previous SELECT is sent. kind mismatch error occurs!

        - Process status display has extra space on FreeeBSD(Jun Kuriyama)

        - Fix incorrect kind mismatch detection case. e.g: BEGIN;
          BEGIN; (Tatsuo Ishii)

        - If PostgreSQL sends lots of DEBUG message, sometimes pgpool
          complains:
          2008-11-08 22:41:53 ERROR: pid 23744: do_command: backend does not
          return ReadyForQuery. This due to a wrong assumption for the
          client/server protocol(Tatsuo Ishii)

        - Fix the case when sending an erronous query to abort
          transaction. It assumed that after sending an error query,
          always ReadyForQuery came right after that. If some
          debugging or logging verboseness is set, PostgreSQL might
          sends NOTICE before ReadyForQuery(Tatsuo Ishii)

        - Query cancelation now works. It never worked since pgpool-II
          was born(Tatsuo Ishii)

        - Fix online recovery to wait for failback done before
          allowing to accept connections from clients. It was supposed
          to work like this but actually was not since the day 0 when
          online recovery was born. Without the fix there could be
          potential data inconsistency among DB nodes(Tatsuo Ishii)

        - Fix pgpool-II crash after on line recovery. This happens
          after the failback process adds a recovered node which has
          no connection to the node(Tatsuo Ishii)

        - Fix pgpool-II errors when postgresql.conf is reloaded. This
          was caused by parameter status packet sent asynchronously
          from backend, which indicates the internal setting of
          backend has been changed(Tatsuo Ishii)

      __________________________________________________________________

* Incompatible changes

        - Always fail over and restart all children. Before we do
          restart only if master has not been changed. This is
          wrong. If we have trouble with network cable or something,
          TCP/IP stack keeps on retrying for long time and the only
          way to prevent it is restarting process(Tatsuo Ishii)

        - "logdir" is no more used. Instead use
          "pid_file_name"(Tatsuo Ishii)

        - Default value for insert_lock is now true(Tatsuo Ishii)

      __________________________________________________________________

* Replication

        - Always start a new transaction even if the query is not in
          an explicit transaction to enhance the reliabilty of
          replication(Yoshiyuki Asaba)
        - Enhance the performance of replication for write
          queries. Now the worst case is 1/2 compared with single DB
          node regardless the number of DB nodes. Previous release
          tends to degrade according to the numer of DB
          nodes(Yoshiyuki Asaba)
        - Add "online recovery" which allows to add a DB node and sync
          with other DB nodes without stopping the pgpool
