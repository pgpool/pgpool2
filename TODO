* General

- Add backend id to statement log(this item was reolved in 2.3)

- Show PostgreSQL backend process ids in process status

- Prepare for changing postgresql.conf directives which produce 'S'
  message. Othewise we get:

  pool_process_query: 1 th kind S does not match with master or majority
  connection kind C

  ERROR: pid 26122: kind mismatch
  among backends. Possible last query was: "UPDATE branches SET bbalance
  = bbalance + -3820 WHERE bid = 1;" kind details are: 0[C] 1[S]

  It seems PostgreSQL sends following parameter status at the *first* pgpool.conf reload only.

- Drop table should be in a transactin block? It is judged here:

POOL_STATUS start_internal_transaction(POOL_CONNECTION_POOL *backend, Node *node)
{
	int i;

	/* if we are not in a transaction block,
	 * start a new transaction

	if (TSTATE(backend) == 'I' &&
		(IsA(node, InsertStmt) || IsA(node, UpdateStmt) ||
		 IsA(node, DeleteStmt) || IsA(node, SelectStmt)))

  detect_error() checks following  NOTICE(ERRRO¤Î25001 means /* SET

  this will send an error query to abort a transaction.

========================

  this happens when replication true, insert_lock true, replicate_select false,
  load_balance false.

  if replicate_select is true, prepared_xacts fails(because \d fails)
  and prepared transactio remain, which keep a lock on pg_class in
  access share mode. And alter table pg_class cannot obtain exclusive
  lock, which causes all SELECTs suspend and regression cannot contiunue.

- Allow client encoding conversion. This was possible in pgpool-I

- Allow special comment such as "/* STRICT */". This was possible in pgpool-I

- Allow multi statement

- Sometimes query is sent to a DB node despite its weight is 0

- Avoid cross pgpool process deadlock situation. This is a long
  standing problem since pgpool-II was born (pgpool-I avoids this by
  setting timeout)

- Allow to stop PostgeSQL from pgpoolAdmin to make the on-line
  recovery more convenient. This requires something like
  pgpool_remote_stop to be specified in pgpool.conf.

- If DISCARD ALL is specified in the reset_query_list and transaction
  is not closed when client disconnects, automatically issue ABORT
  before issuing DISCARD ALL

- Add SSL support(this item was resolved in 2.3.2)

- Allow to specify queries issued when starting sessions

- Audit functionality?

- Make accept queue

- Graceful shutdown, attach, detach

* Query handling

- Enhance DROP DATABASE handling (not disconnect all idle connections)

* Replication

- Allow to replicate timestamp value (this item was resolved in 2.3)

- Allow per table replication

- Allow per session level and query level load balancing

- Allow replication of SEQUENCE

- Allow replication of OID

- Allow to specify functions to be replicated other than nextval(),
  setval()

* Master/slave mode

- Send query to master only if SELECT uses temp tables

* On line recovery

- Allow recovery_1st_stage_command to get PostgreSQL listen port,
  database cluster directory etc. info

* Query cache

- Cache invalidation

- More effcient cache (memcache?)

* Parallel query

- Performance enhance for more complex queries

- Allow to handle transaction

- Allow to handle extended queries

- process alias in FROM clause
