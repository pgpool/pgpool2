    There are many configuration parameters that affect the behavior of
    the database system. In the first section of this chapter we
    describe how to interact with configuration parameters. The subsequent sections
    discuss each parameter in detail.

      <para>
	All parameter names are case-insensitive. Every parameter takes a
	value of one of five types: boolean, string, integer, floating point,
	or enumerated (enum).  The type determines the syntax for setting the
	parameter:
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Boolean:</emphasis>
	    Values can be written as

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>String:</emphasis>
	    In general, enclose the value in single quotes, doubling any single

	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Numeric with Unit:</emphasis>
	    Some numeric parameters have an implicit unit, because they describe
	    quantities of memory or time. The unit might be kilobytes, blocks
	    (typically eight kilobytes), milliseconds, seconds, or minutes.
	    An unadorned numeric value for one of these settings will use the
	    setting's default unit, which can be learned from
	    <structname>pg_settings</>.<structfield>unit</>.
For convenience, settings can be given with a unit specified explicitly,
for example <literal>'120 ms'</> for a time value, and they will be
converted to whatever the parameter's actual unit is.  Note that the
value must be written as a string (with quotes) to use this feature.
The unit name is case-sensitive, and there can be whitespace between
the numeric value and the unit.

<itemizedlist>

      Valid memory units are <literal>kB</literal> (kilobytes),
      <literal>MB</literal> (megabytes), <literal>GB</literal>

      The multiplier for memory units is 1024, not 1000.

    Enumerated-type parameters are written in the same way as string
    parameters, but are restricted to have one of a limited set of

<sect2 id="config-setting-configuration-file">
  <title>Parameter Interaction via the Configuration File</title>

  <para>
    The most fundamental way to set these parameters is to edit the file
    <filename>postgresql.conf</><indexterm><primary>postgresql.conf</></>,
which is normally kept in the data directory.  A default copy is
installed when the database cluster directory is initialized.
An example of what this file might look like is:
<programlisting>
  # This is a comment
  log_connections = yes
  log_destination = 'syslog'
  search_path = '"$user", public'
  shared_buffers = 128MB
</programlisting>
One parameter is specified per line. The equal sign between name and
value is optional. Whitespace is insignificant (except within a quoted
parameter value) and blank lines are
ignored. Hash marks (<literal>#</literal>) designate the remainder
of the line as a comment.  Parameter values that are not simple
identifiers or numbers must be single-quoted.  To embed a single
quote in a parameter value, write either two quotes (preferred)
or backslash-quote.
</para>

<para>
  Parameters set in this way provide default values for the cluster.
  The settings seen by active sessions will be these values unless they
  are overridden.  The following sections describe ways in which the
  administrator or user can override these defaults.
</para>

<para>
  <indexterm>
    <primary>SIGHUP</primary>
  </indexterm>
  The configuration file is reread whenever the main server process
  receives a <systemitem>SIGHUP</> signal; this signal is most easily
sent by running <literal>pg_ctl reload</> from the command line or by
calling the SQL function <function>pg_reload_conf()</function>. The main
server process also propagates this signal to all currently running
server processes, so that existing sessions also adopt the new values
(this will happen after they complete any currently-executing client
command).  Alternatively, you can
send the signal to a single server process directly.  Some parameters
can only be set at server start; any changes to their entries in the
configuration file will be ignored until the server is restarted.
Invalid parameter settings in the configuration file are likewise
ignored (but logged) during <systemitem>SIGHUP</> processing.

	<productname>PostgreSQL</productname> provides three SQL

  Values set with <command>ALTER DATABASE</> and <command>ALTER ROLE</>
are applied only when starting a fresh database session.  They

Note that some settings cannot be changed after server start, and
so cannot be set with these commands (or the ones listed below).

  <title>Parameter Interaction via the Shell</title>

  <para>
    In addition to setting global defaults or attaching
    overrides at the database or role level, you can pass settings to
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> via shell facilities.
    Both the server and <application>libpq</> client library
accept parameter values via the shell.
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      During server startup, parameter settings can be
      passed to the <command>postgres</command> command via the
      <option>-c</> command-line parameter.  For example,
<programlisting>
  postgres -c log_connections=yes -c log_destination='syslog'
</programlisting>
Settings provided in this way override those set via
<filename>postgresql.conf</> or <command>ALTER SYSTEM</>,
so they cannot be changed globally without restarting the server.
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
  <para>
    When starting a client session via <application>libpq</>,
parameter settings can be
specified using the <envar>PGOPTIONS</envar> environment variable.
Settings established in this way constitute defaults for the life
of the session, but do not affect other sessions.
For historical reasons, the format of <envar>PGOPTIONS</envar> is
similar to that used when launching the <command>postgres</command>
command; specifically, the <option>-c</> flag must be specified.
For example,
<programlisting>
  env PGOPTIONS="-c geqo=off -c statement_timeout=5min" psql
</programlisting>

  Other clients and libraries might provide their own mechanisms,
  via the shell or otherwise, that allow the user to alter session

<sect2 id="config-includes">
  <title>Managing Configuration File Contents</title>

  <para>
    <productname>PostgreSQL</> provides several features for breaking
down complex <filename>postgresql.conf</> files into sub-files.
These features are especially useful when managing multiple servers
with related, but not identical, configurations.
</para>

<para>
  <indexterm>
    <primary><literal>include</></primary>
<secondary>in configuration file</secondary>
</indexterm>
In addition to individual parameter settings,
the <filename>postgresql.conf</> file can contain <firstterm>include
  directives</>, which specify another file to read and process as if
it were inserted into the configuration file at this point.  This
feature allows a configuration file to be divided into physically
separate parts.  Include directives simply look like:
<programlisting>
  include 'filename'
</programlisting>
If the file name is not an absolute path, it is taken as relative to
the directory containing the referencing configuration file.
Inclusions can be nested.
</para>

<para>
  <indexterm>
    <primary><literal>include_if_exists</></primary>
<secondary>in configuration file</secondary>
</indexterm>
There is also an <literal>include_if_exists</> directive, which acts
the same as the <literal>include</> directive, except
when the referenced file does not exist or cannot be read.  A regular
<literal>include</> will consider this an error condition, but
<literal>include_if_exists</> merely logs a message and continues
processing the referencing configuration file.
</para>

<para>
  <indexterm>
    <primary><literal>include_dir</></primary>
<secondary>in configuration file</secondary>
</indexterm>
The <filename>postgresql.conf</> file can also contain
<literal>include_dir</literal> directives, which specify an entire
directory of configuration files to include.  These look like
<programlisting>
  include_dir 'directory'
</programlisting>
Non-absolute directory names are taken as relative to the directory
containing the referencing configuration file.  Within the specified
directory, only non-directory files whose names end with the
suffix <literal>.conf</literal> will be included.  File names that
start with the <literal>.</literal> character are also ignored, to
prevent mistakes since such files are hidden on some platforms.  Multiple
files within an include directory are processed in file name order
(according to C locale rules, i.e. numbers before letters, and
uppercase letters before lowercase ones).
</para>

<para>
  Include files or directories can be used to logically separate portions
  of the database configuration, rather than having a single large
  <filename>postgresql.conf</> file.  Consider a company that has two
database servers, each with a different amount of memory.  There are
likely elements of the configuration both will share, for things such
as logging.  But memory-related parameters on the server will vary
between the two.  And there might be server specific customizations,
too.  One way to manage this situation is to break the custom
configuration changes for your site into three files.  You could add
this to the end of your <filename>postgresql.conf</> file to include
them:
<programlisting>
  include 'shared.conf'
  include 'memory.conf'
  include 'server.conf'
</programlisting>
All systems would have the same <filename>shared.conf</>.  Each
server with a particular amount of memory could share the
same <filename>memory.conf</>; you might have one for all servers
with 8GB of RAM, another for those having 16GB.  And
finally <filename>server.conf</> could have truly server-specific
configuration information in it.
</para>

<para>
  Another possibility is to create a configuration file directory and
  put this information into files there. For example, a <filename>conf.d</>
directory could be referenced at the end of <filename>postgresql.conf</>:
<programlisting>
  include_dir 'conf.d'
</programlisting>
Then you could name the files in the <filename>conf.d</> directory
like this:
<programlisting>
  00shared.conf
  01memory.conf
  02server.conf
</programlisting>
This naming convention establishes a clear order in which these
files will be loaded.  This is important because only the last
setting encountered for a particular parameter while the server is
reading configuration files will be used.  In this example,
something set in <filename>conf.d/02server.conf</> would override a
value set in <filename>conf.d/01memory.conf</>.
</para>

<para>
  You might instead use this approach to naming the files
  descriptively:
  <programlisting>
    00shared.conf
    01memory-8GB.conf
    02server-foo.conf
  </programlisting>
  This sort of arrangement gives a unique name for each configuration file
  variation.  This can help eliminate ambiguity when several servers have
  their configurations all stored in one place, such as in a version
  control repository.  (Storing database configuration files under version
  control is another good practice to consider.)
